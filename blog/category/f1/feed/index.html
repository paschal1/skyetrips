Top drivers in the fastest, most technologically-advanced racing cars on the planet, doing battle for the ultimate prize – the world championship.</p>
<p>The circuits are often as incredible as the racing, from traditional grand prix tracks boasting decades of history, to ultra-modern facilities setting new standards for design.</p>
<p>Here are the top 10 circuits that we think every F1 fan should see, plus details on the newest F1 venue: the Miami International Autodrome.</p>
<h3>Albert Park, Australian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> venue is a must-visit for F1 fans with serious wanderlust. The circuit itself is fast and flowing, the unique blend of street and permanent track features making it a real challenge for drivers. </p>
<p>Albert Park took advantage of the COVID-19 hiatus by making some major improvements to the circuit including widening pit lane as well as some of the corners and eliminating two turns. There are also plans to resurface the entire track before the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. </p>
<p>Even if you’ve attended the race before, the track renovations will offer a whole new viewing experience. And with the bustling Melbourne CBD on one side, and the eclectic seaside village of St Kilda on the other, you won’t be short of options for post-race socializing.</p>
<h3>Monaco Street Circuit, Monaco Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The jewel in Formula 1’s crown. Modern grand prix cars outgrew the<br />
famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaco street circuit</a> decades ago, but nobody cares.</p>
<p>Monaco is about the spectacle of watching great drivers thread the 900-horsepower needle through the Principality. It’s about the glamour and being seen in beautiful places with beautiful people.</p>
<p>There are no bad seats at the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. If you love Formula 1, this one has got to be top of the bucket list.</p>

<h3>Marina Bay, Singapore Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Singapore is spectacular enough all on its own. But throw in a Formula 1 race right in the city center, under lights no less, and you have something truly special.</p>
<p>As the original night race of the Formula 1 calendar, the  <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/singapore-grand-prix/">Singapore Grand Prix</a> has become a modern classic. Not only is the backdrop stunning, but Formula 1 cars just look faster under lights.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a> and its amazing night life literally surrounding the circuit caps off an incredible fan experience.</p>

<h3>Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The home of the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/italian-grand-prix/">Italian Grand Prix</a> is one of the most traditional circuits on the calendar, its history dating back to the 1920s.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ‘Tifosi’, the passionate band of Ferrari supporters, race day at Monza feels as much like a soccer match as it does a motor race.</p>
<p>Not only is the track one of the most historic venues on the Formula 1 calendar, it also happens to be located in one of Italy’s most alluring cities. Milan is known for being a leader in fashion and design and also boasts amazing eateries and fascinating cultural attractions.</p>

<h3>Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexican Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Like in Italy, it’s the crowd atmosphere that makes the latest incarnation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexican Grand Prix</a> so special.</p>
<p>The circuit features a unique stadium section built around the tight, twisty Turns 13/14/15 complex. Packed with fans cheering on local hero Sergio Perez, the stadium has quickly become a modern icon in grand prix racing.</p>
<h3>Silverstone, British Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The famous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> British circuit</a> is steeped in history, with the first race of the modern F1 era having taken place at Silverstone back in 1950.</p>
<p>Having been recently redeveloped, Silverstone now has modern, world-class facilities. The circuit itself, however, is still deliciously old school, retaining the fast, open nature that exposes its air base roots.</p>
<h3>Red Bull Ring, Austrian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Set to a stunning Styrian backdrop, the Red Bull Ring is another blend of classic flair and modern design.</p>
<p>Its latest stint as a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grand prix venue</a> has been underpinned by Austrian drinks giant Red Bull, which means little expense has been spared.</p>
<p>Between the rolling hillsides, the flowing track layout and the local love for Red Bull Racing, a trip to Spielberg is sure to impress.</p>
<h3>Circuit of the Americas, US Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Since joining the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/calendar-of-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F1 calendar</a> in 2012, the annual trip to COTA has become a favorite for drivers, teams and fans.</p>
<p>That’s partly due to the track, with its unique uphill run to the first turn and flowing, technical layout.</p>
<p>But the real drawcard is <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/united-states-grand-prix/">Austin</a> and its famous night life, which over a race weekend attracts people from all walks of F1 life.</p>

<h3>Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Pouhon, Les Combes, La Source… Spa-Francorchamps, nestled in the Ardennes, is home to some of the world’s most famous corners.</p>
<p>But none are bigger, better or faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belgian circuit’s</a> calling card – Eau Rouge. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a single more spectacular place to watch Formula 1 cars.</p>
<p>Adding to the Spa spectacle are the thousands of Dutch fans that flock across the border, all dressed in orange, to passionately support Max Verstappen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-32416 size-full" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg" alt="Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Yas Marina, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/auto-racing-packages/abu-dhabi-grand-prix/">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> venue encapsulates the modern opulence that the Middle East is famous for. But while it may be one of the newer kids on the block in terms of Formula 1 circuits, the marina itself – packed with the yachts of the rich and famous – gives it an old school grand prix feel.</p>
<p>Adding to the spectacle is the grand finish under lights, which marks the end of the season and the crowning of a new world champion.</p>
<p>To fully immerse in the experience, stay in one of the many luxury hotels on Yas Island. You may even find that your room overlooks the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/10-amazing-facts-abu-dhabis-yas-marina-circuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit</a>.</p>

<h3>Miami International Autodrome, Miami Grand Prix</h3>
<p>In 2022, the US will host two F1 races. The Miami Grand Prix is the newest addition to the calendar and excitement is already high for the inaugural race. The brand-new host circuit is the first to be designed by Formula 1, specifically for a Grand Prix race. The final design was chosen from over 75 variations that were in consideration. Built on the site of Miami’s popular Hard Rock Stadium, the track was planned with multiple overtaking opportunities to provide maximum excitement during the race. </p>
<p>In addition to F1’s newest race, Miami also boasts legendary nightlife, stunning beaches, and plenty of sunshine, all adding to the allure of the event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="166" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-300x166.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="spanish area map" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>If you’ve never been to Barcelona, you’re missing out on incredible architectural wonders, historical sites, pristine beaches, delicious food, and exciting sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/spanish-grand-prix/">Spanish Grand Prix</a>. If you’re a racing fan, you don’t want to miss the excitement that builds in Spain around the prestigious event. It’s held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya annually, and the track is perhaps the most diverse in the Formula One circuit, with every type of corner.</p>
<p>More than just the Spanish Grand Prix awaits you. Barcelona harbors a rich history, much of it evident in the architecture of the city. You can’t miss the Sagrada Familia, a basilica that has been under construction since 1882. It was designed by Gaudi, whose inspiration is seen throughout the city as a way to employ some of the poor, out of work citizens of the city. Still under construction, it still has not reached its full intended height of 600 feet.<span id="more-19194"></span></p>
<p>Another architectural wonder is the Gothic Quarter, the city center of Barcelona. There you’ll find a variety of styles and plenty of activities; including street artists, dance clubs (discoteks), and tons of excellent Spanish food. You’ll also find it intriguing to visit the Olympic Grounds, where the 1992 Summer Olympics were held and the Olympic Stadium still stands. This spot overlooks the beautiful city from above, giving you a splendid view.</p>
<p>While you’re in the area, visit Nova Icaria Beach, one of the most beautiful seaside locations in Barcelona. Here, you can bask in the sun or take part in watersports, including taking lessons in windsurfing, paddle boarding, and kayaking. The beach is next to the Olympic marina and observatory and also near the Icaria shopping center. If you’re looking for a quieter day at the beach, check out Ocata Beach, with its white sand, just a half-hour train trip outside the city.</p>
<p>Barcelona is a center for liberal arts and culture, so you’ll want to take advantage of the vast array of art. One specific piece of art that is a huge attraction is the Magic Fountain of Montjuic – also known fondly as the ‘dancing’ fountain. Watch the water change colors and dance to a soundtrack of music, and admire the construction of the beautiful piece.</p>
<p>Another excellent place to view visual art is the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, a palace full of art dating all the way from the 11th century up through modern times. If you like the palatial look, visit another of Gaudi’s architectural wonders, the Palau Guell, opened in 1888 as the home of industrial tycoon Eusebi Guell. Today, you can purchase tour tickets to explore the mansion and see how the ‘other half’ lived over a century ago.</p>
<p>When it comes time to sample the cuisine, you’ll find a rich variety of cultures from which to choose. If you want to sample the taste of Catalan, the province in which Barcelona is located, try <a href="http://www.mandarinoriental.com/barcelona/fine-dining/moments/">Moments</a>, where you can try veal stew, or an incredible shrimp tartare. If you want something completely out of the norm, this restaurant also has a unique ‘anti-aging’ menu. You might also check out <a href="http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/Barcelona/Dining/Arola/Default.htm">Arola</a>, located in the Hotel Arts, for its beautiful terrace and live music. Try the seabass asada, with one of the over 900 wines in their cellar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/spanish-grand-prix/">Spanish Grand Prix</a> may be the event that brings you to Barcelona, but once you’re there, you’ll want to stay a while and really enjoy the rich and welcoming environment of the city.

Fact is, as much as we love heading to Monte Carlo for the fantastic sports cars and race itself, we must admit that the stars and royalty in attendance are a big part of what makes this such a fun event to attend year after year.</p>
<p>Those attending this year had the opportunity to hobnob with the likes of Patrick Dempsey, Lady Victoria Hervey, Victoria Silvstedt, several of the cast of Game of Thrones, and Ronan Keating, to namedrop a few of the famous folks in attendance. Lewis Hamilton happily posed for selfies with fans, and superstar DJ Carl Cox played a set at Zelo’s nightclub in Monaco.</p>
<p>Whether you’re impressed with movie stars, royalty, or celebrities of the sporting kind, Monaco never disappoints. Duane Penner, Skyetrips VP of Sales, attends the Monaco Grand Prix almost every year, and says that his biggest sightings over the years have included Bono, David Beckham, Elizabeth Hurley, and David Hasselhoff. “I was there one year partying with Boris Becker. For some people that’s just an old guy they’ve never heard of, but to me he is one of the greatest tennis players ever,” says Penner.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://amber-lounge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Lounge</a> is where the hottest Monaco Grand Prix parties happen, and access is an add-on that many of our guests choose to do with us when coming to this event.</p>
<p>“The drivers come every Sunday to the Amber Lounge, so if you’re an F1 fan then it&#8217;s super cool because all the guys are there and they’re hanging out together, looking to have a good time now that the stress is over. It’s quite the party,” Penner says. “The drivers being there pulls out the other celebrities, such as Nicole Scherzinger who is dating a driver, plus there are supermodels, and past-drivers are all there. The Prince of Monaco and his wife are always at the Amber Lounge at least once, which is also pretty cool.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14876" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/monaco-montage-250x125.jpg" alt="monaco montage" width="250" height="125" /></p>
<p>The Amber Lounge is one of the best places to spot celebrities en mass, literally hanging out in groups, which is quite the thing to see. You’ll also see them in hospitality, either in one of the team paddocks or clubs. “Sometimes you’ll be there in a paddock and not realize that you’re standing just a few feet away from a celebrity until they flash up on one of the screens there,” says Penner.</p>
<p>It rained on race day this year, which was annoying, but it did lead to a very dramatic race with all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7xWlMrRVtY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crashes</a> and messing up on the tire change – this will be a race that people will talk about for a long time just because it had so much drama. “There’s always something different with Monaco, but the things that stay the same – the cars, the celebrities, the yachts, the money – just make it incredible,” says Penner. “Every year we take guests who aren’t even race fans, they just go because all that history and glamour attracts them. For some people it&#8217;s just something that they have to check off the bucket list, but for other people they go regularly.”</p>
<p><em>Are you ready to cross the Monaco Grand Prix off of your bucket list? We’re organizing another great trip there for 2017, and can create a customized itinerary that gets you close to the race action and all the fabulous extras that make this event so special.

The location is visually stunning, you get closer to the action than at any other track, the venue is state-of-the-art, and every attendee gets treated like a VIP. For these reasons alone, heading to Abu Dhabi is a dream trip, but there are also many other reasons why this destination is so special. Here are a few:</p>
<p><strong>Rich cultural experiences</strong> Right now, several huge museums are being constructed in the Saadiyat Cultural District, including the <a href="http://www.saadiyatculturaldistrict.ae/en/saadiyat-cultural-district/louvre-abu-dhabi/">Louvre Abu Dhabi</a> &#8211; as a second location for the famous Paris art museum, and the third Guggenheim Museum, which has been designed by Frank Gehry. Abu Dhabi is getting more culturally exciting all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Incredible hotels </strong>Luxury takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to hotels in Abu Dhabi. Things you might consider high-end at hotels in Europe and North America come as standard in Abu Dhabi, and hotels compete to offer the very best and unique perks. These perks include private malls, water parks, spas that go beyond anything you&#8217;ll have experienced anywhere else in the world, dedicated lifestyle consultants, and much more. Also, because hotels are competing to be the best, rates are very competitive so it can feel like you&#8217;re getting quite the bargain compared to what you&#8217;d pay elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>A rich heritage</strong> Abu Dhabi isn&#8217;t just about what&#8217;s new and exciting and imported from elsewhere, it has a rich culture of its own that is easy to access. Want to go out in the desert with a falconry master? Experience a night under the stars on silk cushions listening to traditional music and feasting? There are many wonderful experiences you can take part in that reflect Abu Dhabi&#8217;s history and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping</strong> Yes there are fabulous upscale malls where you can splurge on whatever designer clothes, shoes, bags etc make you happy, but you can also venture out to traditional souks and bazaars to track down authentic local wares to take home. There&#8217;s even a traditional camel market that you can visit &#8211; though that may be a bigger souvenir than you&#8217;d actually want to take home with you!</p>
<p><strong>World class dining</strong> All the luxury that you&#8217;ll find in Abu Dhabi also spills over into the city&#8217;s flourishing restaurant scene. You&#8217;ll find restaurants from the likes of Marco Pierre White and Hakkasan (whose sister restaurant in London is Michelin starred), and all manner of cuisine from South African steakhouses to Chinese inspired to Mediterranean style plates and more. Whatever food you love, you&#8217;ll be happy eating in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p><strong>The nightlife</strong> If you&#8217;re in Abu Dhabi around F1 time, the nightlife there is crazy fun (and of course Roadtrips will get you into the best parties). You&#8217;ll have a chance not only to socialize with the drivers at the Amber Lounge after the race, but also with the many visiting celebrities that head there to celebrate too (in the past this has included the likes of Bono, Naomi Campbell, Liz Hurley, Rod Stewart, and many more).</p>
<p><em>Want to experience Abu Dhabi? Come with us to this year&#8217;s <a title="2015 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix" href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> and we&#8217;ll make sure that you have an incredible time, and see whatever it is that interests you most about this fascinating city.</em></p>

Opened in 2009, Yas Marina Circuit has many stunning and unique features that draw in drivers and spectators alike. Here are 10 of the most interesting facts about this amazing F1 circuit:</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1. Yas Marina Circuit at night </span></h2>
<p>The first Abu Dhabi Grand Prix held at the Yas Marina Circuit had a 5:00 pm start time, the first time in F1 history that a race was held in the dark. The Circuit is not only equipped to hold events at night, but the track can also be sectioned into two tracks to run two races simultaneously.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2. Abu Dhabi race track construction cost</span></h2>
<p>The Yas Marina Circuit is one of the most technologically-advanced racing circuits in the world. It was also the most expensive to build, with an estimated construction cost of US$1 billion. <span id="more-19139"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">3. Yas Marina Circuit facts </span></h2>
<p>The track is 5.55 kilometres (3.45 miles) long, with 21 turns. The average lap time is 1 minute and 40 seconds. Top speeds can reach 317 km/hr with average speeds of 198 km/hr.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">4. Longest F1 track</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit was designed with four main acceleration periods including a 1173 meter acceleration, which is the longest of any F1 track in the world.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5. Yas Marina Circuit pit lane</span></h2>
<p>The pit lane exits cross under the circuit so part of the pit lane is below ground. Drivers have over 70 garages in two pit buildings, making it a superior circuit for drivers.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">6. Best F1 track for spectators</span></h2>
<p>The Yas Marina Circuit can hold up to 50,000 spectators. There are four grandstands in total, and each is covered and shaded to protect race fans from the desert sun. This is the only covered seating F1 circuit, which helps to make it one of the best facilities in the world for spectators.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">7. Abu Dhabi hotel over F1 track</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit features a 12-story, 499 room, luxury resort hotel over the race circuit. The five-star hotel is called the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi Hotel</a> and it forms a bridge over the 18th and 19th turns. The hotel is the first ever built over a F1 circuit.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8. Yas Marina Circuit location </span></h2>
<p>Although only 10 minutes from the airport, the Yas Marina Circuit was built on an island in the United Arab Emirates&#8217; largest city Abu Dhabi, which also happens to the world&#8217;s richest city. Yas is one island of 200 that form the capital.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">9. Yas Marina VIP Sun Tower</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit has a VIP tower that sits at the start/finish line. Called the Sun Tower, it is 60 metres high and affords its guests a luxurious and panoramic view of the entire race track and surrounding features.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">10. Formula Yas 3000 top speed</span></h2>
<p>For hard core race fans, the Circuit also offers drag racing, off-road racing, and a kart center where you can put your own skills to the test. Or, if you prefer, you can attend their driving school and take your turn behind the wheel in a Formula Yas 30000 race car.</p>
<p>For race car enthusiasts, the Yas Marina Circuit offers the cutting edge in race circuit design, F1 racing at its best, and an unparalleled spectator experience. With the World Drivers&#8217; Champion and World Constructors Champions named at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this November, you can be there to experience the action live. <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact us</a> to book your trip now with Roadtrips!</p>

You can be there on race day to see who takes the checkered flag by booking a customized sports travel trip through <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadtrips</a>.</p>
<p>As a race car fan, the likely place to start is with your itinerary is with the races. You can choose to attend the practice sessions on Friday, the qualifying sessions on Saturday, and the F1 circuit race on Sunday. If you choose all three race days, plan to arrive Thursday and leave Monday. Or, just attend race day, it&#8217;s entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Once you do decide on the dates to attend the United States Grand Prix 2014, then Roadtrips will book your flight be it economy, first class, or private jet. Transportation from your home to the airport, and airport to hotel will of course be arranged for you.<span id="more-19135"></span></p>
<p>Your Grand Prix experience wouldn&#8217;t be yours if you didn&#8217;t choose your seating too. Roadtrips has four incredible<a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> seating packages</a> for you to choose from. Each package of Sunday tickets corresponds to one of four grandstands, each of which is located at a strategic turn alongside the 3.4 mile Circuit of the Americas race track.</p>
<p>One of the spectators&#8217; favorite grandstands is located at the spectacular corner of Turn 1. To reach Turn 1 from the start, drivers accelerate up a 133 foot hill then must negotiate an immediate, and blind, left turn. It is a true thrill to watch.</p>
<p>Turn 1 is the spot for hard core enthusiasts because the turns can be so harrowing to watch and are second to none on the F1 circuit. Fortunately for you, Roadtrips&#8217; <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn 1 Hospitality Suite</a> overlooks that corner. You can enjoy drinks, food, and a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the race cars arriving all from the comfort of this private balcony.</p>
<p>With race day action at the United States Grand Prix 2014 planned, customize the rest of your trip by taking full advantage of Roadtrips&#8217; considerable knowledge of Austin-area events and nightlife, and concierge services.</p>
<p>Roadtrips will make reservations at your choice of <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end Austin hotels</a>, the W Hotel Austin or the Hyatt Place Austin Downtown. These award winning hotels are within walking distance of many nightlife attractions, but you also have the option of hiring a private car throughout your stay to drive you out in the evening, as well as to and from the race track.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t want to miss Roadtrips’ exclusive invitation to Austin&#8217;s hottest A-list United States Grand Prix 2014 parties on Friday night. Or, you can choose from a range of other Austin attractions. Roadtrips can book tee times at a local golf club, perhaps a spa treatment or two, or make recommendations for other events. Your hotel concierge services will be among the best in Austin and can act as expert guides to the best of Austin&#8217;s fine dining and life-music venues.</p>

Being one of the most watched F1 Grand Prix events in the world, the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Canadian Grand Prix</a> (Grand Prix du Canada in French) has been a witness to many such moments. First held at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario in 1961, it has been a part of the Formula One World Championship since 1967. The race moved to its present location in Ile Notre-Dame, Montreal in 1978.</p>
<p>Here are 5 of the most memorable moments in Canadian Grand Prix history:<span id="more-19118"></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A bungled pace car interlude (1973)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: The 1973 Canadian Grand Prix was a rain-soaked event that produced unexpected results. On Lap 3, Austrian Niki Lauda driving a BRM took the lead from Ronnie Peterson, driving a Lotus. When Lauda stopped to change tires in the 20th lap, Jody Scheckter and Francois Cevert collided on Lap 33, creating a bungled pace car interlude that allowed Briton Jackie Oliver, American Peter Revson and Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise to take the lead. There was a lot of confusion for hours after the race, but eventually Revson was declared the winner.</span></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Villeneuve&#8217;s amazing car control skill (1981)</span>:</strong> Quebec native Gilles Villeneuve created history in 1987 by becoming the only Canadian to win the Canadian Grand Prix. But in 1981, he demonstrated his amazing car control skill when the front wing of his Ferrari went askew after a crash &#8211; and he managed to drive on to third place in that condition! The race was won by Frenchman Jacques Laffite with Briton John Watson in second place.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A dramatic finale (1991)</span>:</strong> The finale of the 1991 race is considered to be one of the most dramatic in the history of the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Canadian Grand Prix</a>. Nigel Mansell was leading until the very last lap, and he was just a few corners from the finish line when his car failed him. He was quickly overtaken by Nelson Piquet driving a Benneton. This was Piquet&#8217;s 23rd and final Formula One victory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alesi&#8217;s popular win (1995)</span>:</strong> In the 1995 edition of the Grand Prix, Ferrari&#8217;s Jean Alesi took the lead when Michael Schumacher’s vehicle had electrical problems and Damon Hill’s car had a hydraulic failure. His win was voted the most popular race victory of the season, largely because it was the number 27 Ferrari that had once belonged to Gilles Villeneuve. It was also memorable for the fact that Schumacher gave Alesi a lift back to the pits after his car ran out of fuel. It was also the only grand prix win of Alesi&#8217;s racing career.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The longest F1 race in history (2011)</span>:</strong> When rainstorms delayed the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix for hours, it became the longest F1 race in history. But when the race started, Jenson Button zoomed from the last place, caught the German leader Sebastian Vettel, forcing him into making a mistake, and then drove to victory. Afterwards, Jenson described it as his best race ever making it a Canadian Grand Prix 2011 result to go down in history.</li>

This is the historic part of the city and its cobblestone streets and colonial style buildings date back to 1642. The center of the old city is Place Jacques-Cartier, which is famous for restaurants, boutiques and clubs housed in 17<sup>th</sup> century buildings. Something is always happening here and at times you may even be swamped by fellow tourists, but it’s a great place to be any time.</li>

<p><strong>Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix, May 24-27, 2013</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5179" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/monaco-hero2.jpg" alt="monaco" width="250" height="167" /><br />
The <a title="2014 Monaco Grand Prix Packages" href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/monaco-grand-prix-packages/">Monaco Grand Prix</a> is a fan favorite and is seen as a jewel in the crown of the Formula One World Championships. To win this Formula 1 race is very challenging because even the smallest error could be fatal. The track twists and turns down the narrow streets of Monte Carlo and along the harbor front. The nature of the track favours a driver&#8217;s skill rather than the power of his car, calling for the racers to put a strategy into play. This event is viewed by many on patios, in the streets and yachts, as spectators all try to get a piece of the action.<br />
<strong>Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, November 1-4, 2013</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5176" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/abudhabi-250x166.jpg" alt="abudhabi" width="250" height="166" /></p>
<p>This race is one of our favourites because of its exotic locale and exciting circuit. The Yaz Marina Circuit has enough twists and turns to keep the audience enthralled for the duration of the race.

While in <a title="2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix" href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/">Abu Dhabi</a>, be sure to check out cultural sites like the Sheikh Zayed Mosque and Emirates Palace &#8211; there are tons of historical sites neaby.
