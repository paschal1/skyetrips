Next year, the Super Bowl will take place at Raymond James Stadium in sunny Tampa, Florida. Not only does Tampa offer a reprieve from the winter cold for northerners, it also boasts a ton of fun things to see and do. From theme parks to museums to natural beauty, there are plenty of ways to keep yourself entertained. Here is our list of things to do in Tampa:</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46274 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens-300x200.jpg" alt="Busch Gardens Elephants and other Zoo animals in Tampa Florida." width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Busch Gardens Tampa Bay</strong></h2>
<p>Florida is known for many things, and theme parks are just one of them. One of the biggest in the state is <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/">Busch Gardens</a>. If you’re a roller coaster fan, you’ll definitely want to check it out as it is home to some of the most thrilling coasters around. In addition to the <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/rides/">rides</a>, Busch Gardens is home to over 200 species of animals at its <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/zoo/animals/">zoo</a>, known as one of the best in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46278 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk-300x225.jpg" alt="Tampa city Hillsborough river walk near Hillsborough Bay Florida." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Tampa Riverwalk</strong></h2>
<p>For those who love exploring destinations on foot, the Tampa Riverwalk is the perfect spot. This 2.4-mile pedestrian-friendly path connects visitors to museums, shops, restaurants, attractions, and greenspaces along the water. With views of both the river and downtown, the Tampa Riverwalk is an ideal place for a stroll, jog, or leisurely bike ride. You can even plan your visit before you go with <a href="https://tampa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=b714f0a636c540a5b3f6cd669d0cdb4b">this virtual Riverwalk tour</a>.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Florida Aquarium<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46291 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium-300x225.jpg" alt="The Florida Aquarium, Sharks, Turtles and Conger Eels for family to see in Tampa." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.flaquarium.org/">Florida Aquarium</a> is home to over 9,000 aquatic animals. It’s a great place to get an up-close view of some incredible sea creatures. The aquarium is located in downtown Tampa and offers a number of events and experiences you can take advantage of. There is also a café and gift shop on-site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46280 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard-300x225.jpg" alt="Bayshore Boulevard along downtown Tampa waterfront things to do like walking and water views." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Bayshore Boulevard</strong></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, Bayshore Boulevard runs along the waterfront, just south of downtown Tampa. Bayshore is another option for those looking for a place to walk, run, or ride. It also makes for a scenic drive if you have a rental car. Take in panoramic water views on one side or check out stunning homes on the other. Unlike the Riverwalk, there’s not a lot of places to visit along the way, but at 4.5 miles long it’s ideal for exercising or a relaxing walk. In fact, it claims to be the <a href="https://www.tampagov.net/parks-and-recreation/programs/parks-and-facilities/greenways-and-trails/projects-under-development/bayshore-boulevard-greenway">country’s longest continuous sidewalk</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ybor City <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46281 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ybor-city-300x225.jpg" alt="Tampa’s Latin Quarter or Ybor City, an early cigar hub to now trendy historic buildings." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ybor-city-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ybor-city.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></h2>
<p>This fun and eclectic neighborhood is a National Historic Landmark District with a history dating back to the 1880s. Also known as Tampa’s Latin Quarter, it began as a cigar hub (earning Tampa the nickname <a href="https://www.visittampabay.com/cigar-history/">Cigar City</a>) after prominent cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor settled there. Since then, Ybor City has become a popular destination for both visitors and locals, housing trendy boutiques, great restaurants, bars with live music, and historic buildings. There’s plenty of evidence of its beginnings in the cigar factory industry including the <a href="https://www.ybormuseum.org/visit-the-museum">Ybor City Museum</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Tampa Museums</strong></h1>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Super Bowl History and Stats</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>When was the first Super Bowl?</strong></h2>
<p>The first Super Bowl took place on January 15, 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<h2><strong>Who played in the first Super Bowl?</strong></h2>
<p>The first Super Bowl was played between the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL champion Green Bay Packers. The Packers would win the game by a score of 35-10. Green Bay would go on to win the Super Bowl again the following year, this time against the Oakland Raiders of the AFL.</p>
<h2><strong>What do the Super Bowl winners receive?</strong></h2>
<p>The winning team of the Super Bowl is presented with the NFL championship trophy, more commonly referred to as the Vince Lombardi trophy. Lombardi led the Green Bay Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. Upon his death in 1970, the NFL named their trophy after the legendary head coach.</p>
<p>Additionally, a player from one of the participating teams of the Super Bowl is selected as the game’s most valuable player. The M.V.P. typically is chosen from the winning team but there has been an instance of a player on the losing team winning the award. This occurred in Super Bowl V when <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HowlCh00.htm">Chuck Howley</a> of the Dallas Cowboys was selected the M.V.P. of Super Bowl. The Cowboys lost the game to the Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-13.</p>
<h2><strong>Why does the Super Bowl use Roman numerals?</strong></h2>
<p>The Super Bowl has used Roman numerals since Super Bowl V, which took place in 1971. Lamar Hunt, then owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, is credited with introducing the idea. The initial four Super Bowls were retroactively changed to reflect the move to Roman numerals.</p>
<p>Since 1971, the only Super Bowl to not feature Roman numerals was Super Bowl 50.</p>
<h2><strong>What team has won the most Super Bowls?</strong></h2>
<p>The most Super Bowl wins by a single team is six. Two teams share the mark, the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers each have five Super Bowl victories of their own.</p>
<h2><strong>Which teams have not won a Super Bowl?</strong></h2>
<p>There are 12 teams that have yet to win a Super Bowl. They are the</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona Cardinals</li>
<li>Atlanta Falcons</li>
<li>Buffalo Bills</li>
<li>Carolina Panthers</li>

<li>Houston Texans</li>
<li>Jacksonville Jaguars</li>
<li>Los Angeles Chargers</li>
<li>Minnesota Vikings</li>
<li>Tennessee Titans</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the 12, the Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars have yet to make an appearance in the Super Bowl.</p>

<h2>Kentucky Derby</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-27088 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-225x300.jpg" alt="Kentucky Derby Mint Juleps" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />The Kentucky Derby is another of the biggest sporting events in the United States. Each spring, horse enthusiasts converge in Louisville, Kentucky for the first jewel in the triple crown of horse racing.

<h2>Monaco Grand Prix</h2>
<p>If you’re a Formula 1 fan, this iconic race is likely already on your bucket list. Arguably the most prestigious event in car racing, the Monaco Grand Prix is a sporting event like no other.

Even if you’re not a huge race fan, Monaco is an event that we wish everyone could have the pleasure of experiencing.</p>

They’re also unique in that they both feature a variety of sports, and thus appeal to millions of people. But the Games are about more than the best athletes in the world competing; they’re about the world coming together and the incredible atmosphere this creates in the host city from the opening ceremony through the closing ceremony. Whether you’re a fan of summer or winter sports, the Games are something truly extraordinary and there really is nothing that compares.</p>

<h2>College Football Championship</h2>
<p>We know how big college football is in the United States and we knew we couldn’t have a list of must-see sporting events without including it. While it’s hard to pick just one game to feature, the College Football Championship is definitely one of our favorites. We love the opportunity to witness future stars on the biggest stage in college football before they begin their pro career. Another great thing about this event is the timing – taking place in early January, it’s the perfect time of year to get away and have an exciting sports travel experience to look forward to.</p>

<h2>The World Series</h2>
<p>Dating back well over a century, the World Series is one of the most historic and beloved sporting events in the United States. For baseball fans, the sport simply doesn’t get any better. After a hard-fought season, the last two teams remaining battle it out in this best of seven series to determine the best team in baseball. With the series shifting between two host cities, it’s like two events in one. There’s plenty of fanfare surrounding the series, allowing fans to truly immerse themselves in the sport. The World Series is about more than baseball, it’s a beloved celebration of history and tradition.</p>

<h2>The Masters</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-26538 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg" alt="The Masters" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Considered by some to be a rite of passage for golf fans, attending the Masters gives patrons a new appreciation for this prestigious golf tournament. It’s one thing to watch it on TV but once you walk the hills of Augusta National and see those rolling greens close up, you’ll fully understand the difficulty of the course. There are also so many Masters traditions to experience: the pimento cheese sandwiches, the souvenir photo, and of course, loading up on official Masters merchandise at the pro shop. To see the top players close up playing at the biggest golf event in the world is an experience that you’ll remember forever.</p>

<h2>Wimbledon</h2>
<p>If you had to pick only one tennis tournament to attend, we highly recommend Wimbledon. Steeped in history and tradition, it draws thousands of fans every year (the total attendance at the 2019 tournament was just over half a million people). The celebrity sightings, the impossibly green courts, the strawberries and cream, and the Pimms are just a few highlights of the tournament. Of course, there’s the world-class tennis too. There is no championship in tennis more prestigious and the action on the court reflects this. As a bonus, there is also the incredible host city of London with its amazing restaurants, endless shopping, and amazing attractions.</p>

<h2>UEFA European Championship</h2>
<p>Soccer tournaments are some of the biggest events in the world and the UEFA European Championship is no exception. Less formally known as the Euro, the tournament takes place quadrennially and involves national teams of the members of UEFA. Like all major soccer tournaments, the excitement and atmosphere surrounding the event is indescribable and there always seems to be lots of related events and celebrations going on in the host cities. The tournament is usually hosted by a single country (or two in a few cases) but the next edition of the Euro will make history as it will be held in 12 cities in 12 different countries for the first time in its history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0253-0d81bb2489c6-80b7cddc2057-1000--uefa-euro-2016-by-numbers/"><em>2016 UEFA European Championship Total Attendance</em></a><em>: 2,427,303<br />

It also happens to be a lot of fun to attend. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed and it’s the perfect way to cap off the summer.<br />
As one of four Grand Slam tournaments in the sport, it always draws the top players in the world. Plus, it attracts an incredible number of celebrities each year to cheer on the pros. A big part of what makes the US Open so great is its host city of New York. It’s hard to top The Big Apple in terms of great hotels, entertainment, shopping, and dining. The city offers the best of the best and only serves to enhance the US Open experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2019-09-08/2019-09-08_2019_us_open_sets_alltime_attendance_record.html"><em>2019 US Open Total Attendance</em></a><em>: 737,872 (attendance record)<br />

<h2>NCAA Final Four</h2>
<p>We couldn’t have a list of must-see sporting events and not include basketball. Every spring, the nation gets caught up in March Madness, the highlight of the college basketball season. As the top 68 teams in collegiate men’s basketball battle it out to be one of the last four teams remaining, millions of viewers fervently watch on. It all peaks at the semi-final and final games: The Final Four. The crowd is huge and the excitement is unrivalled as fans watch tomorrow’s biggest stars play their hearts out to become national champions.</p>

<p>And there you have it, our list of must-see sporting events. Of course, there are many more great events out there and it was definitely a challenge to narrow it down. Some other favorites include the Daytona 500, the Cricket World Cup, the Indy 500…we could go on and on. We may be a bit biased, but there really is nothing that compares to attending the biggest sporting events in the world.</p>

No stranger to hosting the Super Bowl, this city knows how to keep NFL fans and visitors busy throughout the big weekend and beyond.</p>
<p>With so much to see and do, it’s essential that you plan your visit to make sure you get the most out of your Super Bowl weekend in this vibrant location. To help you decide, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of our favorite things to do in Minneapolis.</p>
<h2>1. The Ultimate Super Bowl Tailgate Party</h2>
<p>Charge up the pre-game excitement with a visit to the Ultimate Tailgate Party. Mingle with NFL players and other VIPs as you enjoy the pregame with the help of a premium open bar and an all-you-can-eat buffet prepared by celebrity chef Guy Fieri and top caterer Aaron May.</p>
<h2>2. Minnehaha Park</h2>
<p>Home to the beautiful Minnehaha Falls and popular with families and dog lovers alike, this city park is the ideal way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a few hours. The falls are one of the most popular features of the park, standing at an impressive 53-feet high. They turn into a gorgeous winter wonderland when the waterfall freezes over the colder months.</p>
<p>Make sure to wrap up warm for this one as temperatures in Minneapolis during February are set <strong><a href="https://weatherspark.com/m/10405/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Minneapolis-Minnesota-United-States" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to be pretty cold</a></strong>. If it’s cold enough, you may just get the chance to see the falls in all their frozen glory!</p>
<h2>3. Foshay Museum and Observation Deck</h2>
<p>If you’re feeling a little adventurous, why not take in the stunning 360-degree views of Minneapolis from 30 floors up? Located at the top of the W Hotel, the Foshay observation deck gives you a view of Minneapolis that you won’t find anywhere else in the city. Our favorite time to check out the view is at night when the lights of the city are brighter than the halftime show.</p>
<p>When you finish, we recommend taking yourself downstairs to the Prohibition Bar where you can sit back and relax with a cocktail in hand.</p>
<h2>4. Spoonbridge and Cherry at the Walker Art Center</h2>
<p>No trip to Minneapolis would be complete without a visit to the famous spoon and cherry sculpture located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. It’s an iconic symbol of Minneapolis and provides an amazing backdrop for some fun picture taking. You can make it look like you’re taking a bite of the cherry or holding the spoon, the finished pictures will make a great Instagram post!</p>
<h2>5. The Mall of America</h2>
<p>You really can’t visit Minneapolis without a spot of shopping, and there’s no better place than The Mall of America, it’s a shopping experience like no other. With over 500 stores and 50 restaurants, there’s something to please everyone. And if you tire of shopping, head over to <strong><a href="https://nickelodeonuniverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nickelodeon Universe</a></strong> and take a ride on the rollercoaster or check out the <strong><a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea Life aquarium</a></strong>. It’s home to thousands of sea creatures, including sharks and sea turtles.</p>
<h2>6. 112 Eatery</h2>
<p>Looking for a buzzing restaurant for a great meal? Then 112 Eatery will fit the bill. Positioned in the heart of downtown Minneapolis, this is one of our favorite spots in the city. Minneapolis chef (and James Beard award winner) Isaac Becker is at the helm and the American cuisine is creative and incredibly delicious. Be sure to reserve a table as this place is super popular.</p>
<h2>7. Minneapolis Institute of Art</h2>
<p>Catch your breath and take some time out from the excitement of Super Bowl weekend with a visit to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Take in the fine art and explore the magnificent exhibitions of everyone from Monet to Van Gogh. Keep up to date with the latest exhibitions taking place this February through their <strong><a href="https://new.artsmia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>8. Try Out a Winter Sport</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that it’s cold in Minneapolis in February so why not embrace it? Super Bowl weekend will be a great time to try out a new winter sport or polish your skills on one you already enjoy. With skating, snowshoeing, ice fishing, snowboarding and many more, there’s sure to be something for everyone.</p>
<h2>9. Sportsology at the Science Museum of Minnesota</h2>
<p>A really fun way to learn some of the science behind sport, this interactive exhibit is a fun way to spend a few hours. Explore different aspects of sport, challenge your travelling companion (or even a professional athlete) to a virtual competition, and check out everything else the exhibit has to offer. There’s plenty to see in the rest of the museum too!</p>
<h2>10. Saint Paul Winter Carnival</h2>
<p>Located just a short drive from the U.S Bank Stadium, the Winter Carnival is an outside party like no other. There are a number of carnival events held between January 25th and February 10th but the Carnival’s signature events – three parades, ice carving, and a snow sculpting competition – are the biggest draw for visitors. So, chill out and wrap up and check out America’s longest running winter festival.</p>

The hustle and bustle in the New York and New Jersey area during <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Super Bowl week</a> is sure to be at an all-time high.  Not only will the sights, shops and subways be busy, the restaurants will be even busier than normal.</p>
<p>With hundreds of dining destinations in the New York area, it’s almost impossible to create a guide that will suit everyone. Places like the Russian Tea Room, 21 Club, Delmonico’s and Per Se offer some of New York’s most iconic dining experiences and if you can get a reservation, definitely worth a try. However, your Roadtrips Super Bowl package will expose you to a few other classics.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Dining</strong><br />
Every <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Super Bowl package</a> will include your choice of prime New York hotel, and every hotel option will also have its own dining options.  Whether it is the Setai Fifth Avenue, the Chatwal Hotel or the Ramada Plaza New Yorker, fine dining will be part of the equation.  Additionally, most of these hotels are within walking distance to some of New York’s best eateries.</p>
<p><strong>The Street</strong><br />
Let’s keep in mind that you’re going to be in New York, and New York is famous for its food trucks and street food. You can get everything from a simple hot dog or pizza slice to sushi to gourmet lobster rolls on the streets of New York, and everyone should give it a try at least once if they are in town.  Once you get in there and try some authentic New York street food, you might find that’s all you really want or need.</p>
<p><strong>The Game</strong><br />
Along with all the eating, remember that you’re in town for a football game.  Not just any football game, it’s the biggest football game on the NFL schedule!  You’ll get prime seats, game day transfers to and from the stadium, optional parties and other events, and you’ll be right there for the famous Super Bowl halftime show.</p>
<p>It’s anybody’s guess which two teams will be left standing when the 2014 Super Bowl arrives, but anyone who signs up for a <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Roadtrips Super Bowl package</a> can be sure that they’ll experience the best that New York and New Jersey have to offer.  Call or email to get started creating your 2014 Super Bowl travel package today.</p>
