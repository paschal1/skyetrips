Top drivers in the fastest, most technologically-advanced racing cars on the planet, doing battle for the ultimate prize – the world championship.</p>
<p>The circuits are often as incredible as the racing, from traditional grand prix tracks boasting decades of history, to ultra-modern facilities setting new standards for design.</p>
<p>Here are the top 10 circuits that we think every F1 fan should see, plus details on the newest F1 venue: the Miami International Autodrome.</p>
<h3>Albert Park, Australian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> venue is a must-visit for F1 fans with serious wanderlust. The circuit itself is fast and flowing, the unique blend of street and permanent track features making it a real challenge for drivers. </p>
<p>Albert Park took advantage of the COVID-19 hiatus by making some major improvements to the circuit including widening pit lane as well as some of the corners and eliminating two turns. There are also plans to resurface the entire track before the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. </p>
<p>Even if you’ve attended the race before, the track renovations will offer a whole new viewing experience. And with the bustling Melbourne CBD on one side, and the eclectic seaside village of St Kilda on the other, you won’t be short of options for post-race socializing.</p>
<h3>Monaco Street Circuit, Monaco Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The jewel in Formula 1’s crown. Modern grand prix cars outgrew the<br />
famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaco street circuit</a> decades ago, but nobody cares.</p>
<p>Monaco is about the spectacle of watching great drivers thread the 900-horsepower needle through the Principality. It’s about the glamour and being seen in beautiful places with beautiful people.</p>
<p>There are no bad seats at the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. If you love Formula 1, this one has got to be top of the bucket list.</p>

<h3>Marina Bay, Singapore Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Singapore is spectacular enough all on its own. But throw in a Formula 1 race right in the city center, under lights no less, and you have something truly special.</p>
<p>As the original night race of the Formula 1 calendar, the  <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/singapore-grand-prix/">Singapore Grand Prix</a> has become a modern classic. Not only is the backdrop stunning, but Formula 1 cars just look faster under lights.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a> and its amazing night life literally surrounding the circuit caps off an incredible fan experience.</p>

<h3>Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The home of the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/italian-grand-prix/">Italian Grand Prix</a> is one of the most traditional circuits on the calendar, its history dating back to the 1920s.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ‘Tifosi’, the passionate band of Ferrari supporters, race day at Monza feels as much like a soccer match as it does a motor race.</p>
<p>Not only is the track one of the most historic venues on the Formula 1 calendar, it also happens to be located in one of Italy’s most alluring cities. Milan is known for being a leader in fashion and design and also boasts amazing eateries and fascinating cultural attractions.</p>

<h3>Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexican Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Like in Italy, it’s the crowd atmosphere that makes the latest incarnation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexican Grand Prix</a> so special.</p>
<p>The circuit features a unique stadium section built around the tight, twisty Turns 13/14/15 complex. Packed with fans cheering on local hero Sergio Perez, the stadium has quickly become a modern icon in grand prix racing.</p>
<h3>Silverstone, British Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The famous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> British circuit</a> is steeped in history, with the first race of the modern F1 era having taken place at Silverstone back in 1950.</p>
<p>Having been recently redeveloped, Silverstone now has modern, world-class facilities. The circuit itself, however, is still deliciously old school, retaining the fast, open nature that exposes its air base roots.</p>
<h3>Red Bull Ring, Austrian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Set to a stunning Styrian backdrop, the Red Bull Ring is another blend of classic flair and modern design.</p>
<p>Its latest stint as a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grand prix venue</a> has been underpinned by Austrian drinks giant Red Bull, which means little expense has been spared.</p>
<p>Between the rolling hillsides, the flowing track layout and the local love for Red Bull Racing, a trip to Spielberg is sure to impress.</p>
<h3>Circuit of the Americas, US Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Since joining the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/calendar-of-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F1 calendar</a> in 2012, the annual trip to COTA has become a favorite for drivers, teams and fans.</p>
<p>That’s partly due to the track, with its unique uphill run to the first turn and flowing, technical layout.</p>
<p>But the real drawcard is <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/united-states-grand-prix/">Austin</a> and its famous night life, which over a race weekend attracts people from all walks of F1 life.</p>

<h3>Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Pouhon, Les Combes, La Source… Spa-Francorchamps, nestled in the Ardennes, is home to some of the world’s most famous corners.</p>
<p>But none are bigger, better or faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belgian circuit’s</a> calling card – Eau Rouge. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a single more spectacular place to watch Formula 1 cars.</p>
<p>Adding to the Spa spectacle are the thousands of Dutch fans that flock across the border, all dressed in orange, to passionately support Max Verstappen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-32416 size-full" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg" alt="Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Yas Marina, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/abu-dhabi-grand-prix/">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> venue encapsulates the modern opulence that the Middle East is famous for. But while it may be one of the newer kids on the block in terms of Formula 1 circuits, the marina itself – packed with the yachts of the rich and famous – gives it an old school grand prix feel.</p>
<p>Adding to the spectacle is the grand finish under lights, which marks the end of the season and the crowning of a new world champion.</p>
<p>To fully immerse in the experience, stay in one of the many luxury hotels on Yas Island. You may even find that your room overlooks the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/10-amazing-facts-abu-dhabis-yas-marina-circuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit</a>.</p>

<h3>Miami International Autodrome, Miami Grand Prix</h3>
<p>In 2022, the US will host two F1 races. The Miami Grand Prix is the newest addition to the calendar and excitement is already high for the inaugural race. The brand-new host circuit is the first to be designed by Formula 1, specifically for a Grand Prix race. The final design was chosen from over 75 variations that were in consideration. Built on the site of Miami’s popular Hard Rock Stadium, the track was planned with multiple overtaking opportunities to provide maximum excitement during the race. </p>
<p>In addition to F1’s newest race, Miami also boasts legendary nightlife, stunning beaches, and plenty of sunshine, all adding to the allure of the event.</p>

Part of the decision is whether to stay at Casino Square, which during the Grand Prix is really quite busy, or to choose a little more space closer to Larvotto Beach. </p>
<p>For those that like to start the day with a walk or run, or want to stay a little outside the bottleneck that is Casino Square, our recommendation would be either the Le Meridien Beach Plaza or the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel. </p>
<h2>LE MERIDIEN BEACH PLAZA</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22838" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Boasting an exclusive private beach, this modern resort hotel is a very nice hotel and a great value during the Grand Prix. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#meridien">Le Meridien</a> has great views to the Mediterranean, is contemporary in design, relaxed and chic in its vibe, and it’s outside of the crush of Casino Square, perfect for an early morning run or a walk on the beach followed by a frothy cappuccino. The food options are good, but not great, though you have lots of great options within a few minutes walk of the hotel. The gym, indoor and outdoor pools, and beach are second to none in Monaco. The rooms are well designed and spacious by European standards. Beds are comfortable and the Malin &#038; Goetz bathroom amenities are a nice touch. </p>
<h2>MONTE CARLO BAY HOTEL </h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg" alt="monte carlo bay" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18134" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This luxury hotel was built on reclaimed land and was a welcome addition to the hotel scene in Monaco. Essentially next door to the Le Meridien, <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#monte">this property</a> also allows you a bit of breathing room during the Grand Prix. This lavishly designed hotel has a Vegas meets French Riviera feel with expensive gardens, a grand entrance, and extensive views of the sea. The swimming pool complex is happening and includes a sand bottomed pool, a giant glass panelled conservatory and a well equipped fitness facility with a plush spa and yoga classes. The rooms are spacious with bathrooms that boast separate shower and bath, with amenities from the hotel’s Cinq Mondes Spa. With an in-house Michelin starred restaurant, Blue Bay, you know they are committed to providing guests with culinary delights. A lagoon-facing terrace at L’Hippocampe and the comfortable Blue Gin Bar both make for a relaxing on-property snack or cocktail. </p>
<h2>HOTEL HERMITAGE</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5-10-300x200.jpg" alt="hotel hermitage" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18122" />One of the grande dames of the hotel scene in Monaco is the elegant <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#hermitage">Hotel Hermitage</a>. This Belle Epoque palace is tucked away behind the Hotel de Paris and is a favorite of those pretending to fly under the radar. This opulent 19th century palace has all the gold leaf and marble topped commodes you would expect, given the line of Lamborghinis and Bentleys “discreetly” parked out front. Service is courteous and competent, with female staff adorned with silk scarves and waistcoated bellboys. Guests can charge any Monte Carlo SBM facilities to their room including one of the most impressive thermal spas in Europe. Rooms feature Louis XV style furniture and wallpaper, bathrooms contain plenty of marble, and products are by the legendary Parisian perfume maker Francis Kurkdjian. The Michelin starred Vistamar may be “the” place for seafood in Monaco, though any of the hotel’s eateries come with plenty of prestige wines and vintage champagne, making sure you don’t forget you are staying in a palace. </p>
<h2>HOTEL METROPOLE</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg" alt="hotel metropole" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18136" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#metropole">The Metropole</a> manages to seamlessly bridge a number of themes and styles, making it the choice for rockstars and royalty alike. Behind the monumental Belle Epoque facade, this hotel perfectly delivers both classic elegance and a relaxed modern vibe. The bar and lounge are a 21st century take on a 19th century drawing room. There are books and tapestries bathed in light and space. Just up from the casino and off the Boulingrins Gardens, it could not be more central. And then there is the name dropping; from the Michelin-starred cuisine at Christophe Cussac’s Yoshi to Karl Lagerfeld’s creation, Odyssey, a pool and restaurant oasis available only to hotel and spa guests, this hotel has cachet to spare. The rooms combine period furniture, flowing fabrics, art and artifacts with contemporary sensitivity and comfort. You will feel like a royal noble, except that these rooms are too well thought out for that. They may be pricey, but live a weekend in them and you will swear it is completely worth it. </p>
<p><b>And, for a hidden gem and completely other experience&#8230; </b></p>
<h2>CAP ESTEL</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg" alt="cap estel monaco" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47905" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Set on a tiny peninsula just outside the borders of Monaco, this small, luxurious gated mansion is the perfect A-list hideaway. Only minutes from the glitz and excitement of the Grand Prix, it offers its guests the very best of discreet service and luxe surroundings. With only 28 rooms and suites across three buildings, each with expansive views of the sea, this lush property combines elegant design and decor with the latest in technology. Add the Michelin starred creations of chef Patrick Raingeard and you truly have the ultimate in discreet luxury and exceptional service. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="166" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-300x166.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="spanish area map" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spanishgp-hero8.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>If you’ve never been to Barcelona, you’re missing out on incredible architectural wonders, historical sites, pristine beaches, delicious food, and exciting sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/spanish-grand-prix/">Spanish Grand Prix</a>. If you’re a racing fan, you don’t want to miss the excitement that builds in Spain around the prestigious event. It’s held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya annually, and the track is perhaps the most diverse in the Formula One circuit, with every type of corner.</p>
<p>More than just the Spanish Grand Prix awaits you. Barcelona harbors a rich history, much of it evident in the architecture of the city. You can’t miss the Sagrada Familia, a basilica that has been under construction since 1882. It was designed by Gaudi, whose inspiration is seen throughout the city as a way to employ some of the poor, out of work citizens of the city. Still under construction, it still has not reached its full intended height of 600 feet.<span id="more-19194"></span></p>
<p>Another architectural wonder is the Gothic Quarter, the city center of Barcelona. There you’ll find a variety of styles and plenty of activities; including street artists, dance clubs (discoteks), and tons of excellent Spanish food. You’ll also find it intriguing to visit the Olympic Grounds, where the 1992 Summer Olympics were held and the Olympic Stadium still stands. This spot overlooks the beautiful city from above, giving you a splendid view.</p>
<p>While you’re in the area, visit Nova Icaria Beach, one of the most beautiful seaside locations in Barcelona. Here, you can bask in the sun or take part in watersports, including taking lessons in windsurfing, paddle boarding, and kayaking. The beach is next to the Olympic marina and observatory and also near the Icaria shopping center. If you’re looking for a quieter day at the beach, check out Ocata Beach, with its white sand, just a half-hour train trip outside the city.</p>
<p>Barcelona is a center for liberal arts and culture, so you’ll want to take advantage of the vast array of art. One specific piece of art that is a huge attraction is the Magic Fountain of Montjuic – also known fondly as the ‘dancing’ fountain. Watch the water change colors and dance to a soundtrack of music, and admire the construction of the beautiful piece.</p>
<p>Another excellent place to view visual art is the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, a palace full of art dating all the way from the 11th century up through modern times. If you like the palatial look, visit another of Gaudi’s architectural wonders, the Palau Guell, opened in 1888 as the home of industrial tycoon Eusebi Guell. Today, you can purchase tour tickets to explore the mansion and see how the ‘other half’ lived over a century ago.</p>
<p>When it comes time to sample the cuisine, you’ll find a rich variety of cultures from which to choose. If you want to sample the taste of Catalan, the province in which Barcelona is located, try <a href="http://www.mandarinoriental.com/barcelona/fine-dining/moments/">Moments</a>, where you can try veal stew, or an incredible shrimp tartare. If you want something completely out of the norm, this restaurant also has a unique ‘anti-aging’ menu. You might also check out <a href="http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/Barcelona/Dining/Arola/Default.htm">Arola</a>, located in the Hotel Arts, for its beautiful terrace and live music. Try the seabass asada, with one of the over 900 wines in their cellar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/spanish-grand-prix/">Spanish Grand Prix</a> may be the event that brings you to Barcelona, but once you’re there, you’ll want to stay a while and really enjoy the rich and welcoming environment of the city.

Yes, the race is always a fantastic time, and the accompanying <a href="http://www.500festival.com/node/89">parade</a> that has been a part of the festivities since 1957 is lots of fun, but the city itself has many charms worth exploring. In this week’s blog post, we wanted to give you a taste of some of the best of Indianapolis that you can check out if you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Fantastic Restaurants </strong><br />
Indianapolis has some incredibly talented chefs producing unforgettable food. If you’re into fresh and inventive, <a href="http://www.milktoothindy.com/">Milktooth</a> made it onto last year’s Eater list of America’s Best Restaurants, and likewise the Condé Nast Traveler list of the same, despite the fact it only serves breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Prefer something more traditional? <a href="http://www.stelmos.com/">St Elmo Steakhouse</a> has been operating since 1902 and serves up classic cuts of meat in a ritzy setting, and the spicy shrimp cocktail is legendary.</p>
<p>If you’re a micro-brew fan, then Indianapolis won’t disappoint – not only are there many <a href="http://www.visitindy.com/indianapolis-whats-on-tap-indy-breweries">breweries</a> to visit, there are also these fun tours where you get pedaled around the city on a bar attached to a bike. You’ll also find beautiful lounges to enjoy a cocktail, or sip on some fine wines. Honestly, whatever food or drinks you’re into, Indianapolis won’t disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Cultural Attractions</strong><br />
There are some excellent museums to explore in Indianapolis. The city is home to the <a href="https://www.childrensmuseum.org/">world’s largest children’s museum</a>, which is fun whether you’re traveling with kids or without. The <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/">Indianapolis Museum of Art</a> is superb, with over 54,000 pieces of art in its permanent collection, spanning 5000 years. If you’re into college sports, then the <a href="http://www.ncaahallofchampions.org/index.php">NCAA Hall of Fame</a> is definitely worth checking out when you’re in the city.</p>
<p>Indianapolis is the home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, and if you’re a fan there are several ways you can pay homage. This year is a good one to visit as the city has declared it the Year of Vonnegut, and you’ll find bars throughout the city have made special cocktails dedicated to his memory with names like Breakfast of Champions referring to his works. There’s a <a href="http://www.vonnegutlibrary.org/">Vonnegut Museum and Gift Shop</a>, with a much bigger one set to open in April, and the new Vonnegut mural on Massachusetts Avenue is well worth checking out.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Speedway Related</strong><br />
Even if you’re visiting Indianapolis outside of the Indy 500 time, you can still visit the legendary <a href="http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>, otherwise known as The Brickyard. You can take a tour, enjoy a racing experience inside a car that’s actually been raced there by pros, or even play a few rounds of golf right inside the Speedway at the Brickyard Crossing Golf Course (four holes are actually inside the midfield, so you can play with cars racing around you).</p>
<p>These are just a few reasons we love visiting Indianapolis, and we can’t finish this post without stating just how friendly the locals are every time we visit (Indianapolis is a big city, but being in the Mid-West, the people are so incredibly welcoming). If you’re interested in coming with us for the next <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/indy-500/">Indy 500</a> in May, <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/contact-us/">contact us</a> now to start planning a customized trip to this epic event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="150" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Monaco-5-things-300x150.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Monaco-5-things-300x150.png 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Monaco-5-things-768x384.png 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Monaco-5-things.png 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Monaco-5-things-512x256.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>We absolutely adore <a href="http://www.visitmonaco.com/">Monaco</a>, and attending the Grand Prix there every year is definitely a highlight for the Skyetrips team. Here are some of the very best things to do when visiting the principality, all of which we can add into your itinerary when you travel with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. ARRIVE IN STYLE If you’re going to do Monaco, you’ve got to do it right and that’s why helicopter transfers from Nice airport are a standard inclusion for our Monte-Carlo guests. Not only will you feel like royalty, you’ll get some spectacular views of the principality and the coast from the air. As a bonus, it’s also the fastest way to get you to this amazing destination.</p>
<p>2. PALAIS DU PRINCE Yes, it’s one of those attractions that you’ll find in every travel guide but it really is spectacular. The walk up to the palace will take you through the narrow cobblestone streets of Old Monte-Carlo (Monaco-Ville), which is deserving of a visit in itself. Once you arrive at the Palais you can marvel at the grandeur of this magnificent piece of architecture, home to the ruling Grimaldi family for over 700 years. It’s worth timing your visit to coincide with the changing of the guard at 11:55 a.m. While you’re there, don’t forget to check out the stunning view (yes, they do seem to be everywhere) of the city down below.</p>
<p>3. CASINO DE MONTE-CARLO This isn’t your typical casino. Even non-gamblers will be impressed by this 150+ year-old famed 1 3 institution. Its elegant Belle Époque décor is stunning and the clientele equally so. Go for the games, the drinks or take a tour. Words don’t do it justice, it’s a must see. People watching at its best.</p>
<p>4. OCEANOGRAPHIC MUSEUM If you’re traveling with the family (or even if you’re not), the <a href="http://www.oceano.mc/en">Oceanographic Museum</a> near the Prince’s Palace is a cool place to visit. The building itself is actually built into the rock, a pretty spectacular sight. There’s close to one hundred aquariums full of thousands of marine species to check out. We also love the rooftop restaurant; it’s a great place for some refreshment during or after your visit.</p>
<p>5. EXOTIC GARDEN OF MONACO There are few things that shock us about Monaco anymore. The principality has everything so why wouldn’t it have one of the world’s most extensive collections of exotic succulents (simply defined as plants which have acclimatized to dry climates e.g. cacti) on display. In all seriousness though, this unique garden is absolutely fascinating. Unlike your typical garden, you’ll wander alongside craggy cliffs and underground caverns. Plants have been brought in from all over the world and put on display in this impressive garden, which has been around for over 80 years.</p>

The iconic Daytona 500 is always fun, and the VIP events that we take our guests to add to the excitement, but there are also lots of other cool things to do in Daytona that we love checking out. Here are nine awesome reasons to visit Daytona besides NASCAR, that make adding a few extra days onto your trip a really good idea.</p>
<p><strong>See where baseball history was made.</strong> You can take a tour of <a href="http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t450&amp;ymd=20100907&amp;content_id=14398794&amp;vkey=team1">Jackie Robinson Ballpark</a>, where the first integrated baseball game happened in the US. The ballpark is home to minor league team the Daytona Tortugas (previously the Daytona Cubs, they recently rebranded).</p>
<p><strong>Search out ‘gators.</strong> Up the adrenalin level by heading out on an airboat to find alligators with Captain Joshua Mattson of <a href="http://www.gatorhunter.com/">Airboat and Gator Charters</a>, or even hunt them in the dark with floodlights if that’s your thing and you happen to visit between August and November (‘gator hunting season).</p>
<p><strong>Cruise Grenada Boulevard.</strong> This boulevard away from the main drag part of the city has lots of charm. Start with lunch at <a href="http://www.grindgastropub.com/">Grind Gastropub</a> with its awesome and funky Kona Tiki Bar out back – big appetites will love Grind’s Signature half-pound burger stuffed with an egg, bacon, and Guinness battered onion rings. Just down the block is local favorite <a href="http://www.hullsseafood.com/">Hull’s Seafood Market</a> where everything sold is fresh off local boats, and meals like their excellent Grouper Sandwich come served with addictively good hush puppies.</p>
<p><strong>Discover classic Daytona.</strong> Starting on the east side of Grenada Boulevard in Ormond Beach, you’ll discover a green and tranquil oasis at the <a href="http://ormondartmuseum.org/">Ormond Memorial Art Museum and Garden</a>. Shady paths lead you between giant ferns, palm trees, and towering bamboo that clatters eerily as you walk by, until you reach a small gallery with diverse shows that change every six to eight weeks. Just one block away is <a href="http://www.thecasements.net/">The Casements</a>, the much loved century old home of John D Rockefeller Senior, which serves as a lovely cultural and historic center these days but offers free tours for those wanting to explore the place, and several artifact filled rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Indulge your sweet tooth.</strong> Pick up delicious old-fashioned candies at <a href="http://angellandphelps.com/">Angell and Phelps Chocolate Factory</a> on South Beach Street, which has been operating since 1925, and enjoy a fun tour showing how the chocolates are made.</p>
<p><strong>Kayak with manatees.</strong> Head out with <a href="http://kayakcentralflorida.com/">Kayak Central Florida</a> to paddle the St Johns River beneath cypress trees bearded with Spanish moss, searching out alligators, manatees, dolphins, and shorebirds.</p>
<p><strong>Go fishing.</strong> Local expert Captain Scott Cornelius of <a href="http://www.thegoodlifecharters.com/">The Good Life Charters</a> will take you down hidden channels off the Tomoka River barely as wide as the boat to search out tasty redfish who put up a real fight to get away in the shallow waters, or catfish at the very least.</p>
<p><strong>Take a sailboat out. </strong>Slow right down by taking a sunset sail boat trip with one of many operators in the area, sipping on your beverage of choice as you look out over the water hoping to glimpse a manatee or passing dolphin or two, and watch the traffic wait patiently as two drawbridges along the Halifax River are raised to let your ship through.</p>
<p><strong>Hit the beach, or drive on it.</strong> If you love long white sandy beaches, then Daytona is your perfect vacation destination. There are 37k of wide beaches for you to sun yourself, play, and surf on. You can even drive your car along most of the beach there, which is an experience in itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="162" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DuaneFancy-300x162.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DuaneFancy-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DuaneFancy-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DuaneFancy.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>If you followed the Monaco Grand Prix news a few weeks back, you’ll have no doubt heard about the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2016/05/27/monaco-grand-prix-celebrities-and-formula-one-stars-arrive-in-mo/">huge array of celebrities in attendance</a>. Fact is, as much as we love heading to Monte Carlo for the fantastic sports cars and race itself, we must admit that the stars and royalty in attendance are a big part of what makes this such a fun event to attend year after year.</p>
<p>Those attending this year had the opportunity to hobnob with the likes of Patrick Dempsey, Lady Victoria Hervey, Victoria Silvstedt, several of the cast of Game of Thrones, and Ronan Keating, to namedrop a few of the famous folks in attendance. Lewis Hamilton happily posed for selfies with fans, and superstar DJ Carl Cox played a set at Zelo’s nightclub in Monaco.</p>
<p>Whether you’re impressed with movie stars, royalty, or celebrities of the sporting kind, Monaco never disappoints. Duane Penner, Skyetrips VP of Sales, attends the Monaco Grand Prix almost every year, and says that his biggest sightings over the years have included Bono, David Beckham, Elizabeth Hurley, and David Hasselhoff. “I was there one year partying with Boris Becker. For some people that’s just an old guy they’ve never heard of, but to me he is one of the greatest tennis players ever,” says Penner.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://amber-lounge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Lounge</a> is where the hottest Monaco Grand Prix parties happen, and access is an add-on that many of our guests choose to do with us when coming to this event.</p>
<p>“The drivers come every Sunday to the Amber Lounge, so if you’re an F1 fan then it&#8217;s super cool because all the guys are there and they’re hanging out together, looking to have a good time now that the stress is over. It’s quite the party,” Penner says. “The drivers being there pulls out the other celebrities, such as Nicole Scherzinger who is dating a driver, plus there are supermodels, and past-drivers are all there. The Prince of Monaco and his wife are always at the Amber Lounge at least once, which is also pretty cool.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14876" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/monaco-montage-250x125.jpg" alt="monaco montage" width="250" height="125" /></p>
<p>The Amber Lounge is one of the best places to spot celebrities en mass, literally hanging out in groups, which is quite the thing to see. You’ll also see them in hospitality, either in one of the team paddocks or clubs. “Sometimes you’ll be there in a paddock and not realize that you’re standing just a few feet away from a celebrity until they flash up on one of the screens there,” says Penner.</p>
<p>It rained on race day this year, which was annoying, but it did lead to a very dramatic race with all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7xWlMrRVtY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crashes</a> and messing up on the tire change – this will be a race that people will talk about for a long time just because it had so much drama. “There’s always something different with Monaco, but the things that stay the same – the cars, the celebrities, the yachts, the money – just make it incredible,” says Penner. “Every year we take guests who aren’t even race fans, they just go because all that history and glamour attracts them. For some people it&#8217;s just something that they have to check off the bucket list, but for other people they go regularly.”</p>
<p><em>Are you ready to cross the Monaco Grand Prix off of your bucket list? We’re organizing another great trip there for 2017, and can create a customized itinerary that gets you close to the race action and all the fabulous extras that make this event so special. Contact us to start planning this dream trip.</em></p>

The location is visually stunning, you get closer to the action than at any other track, the venue is state-of-the-art, and every attendee gets treated like a VIP. For these reasons alone, heading to Abu Dhabi is a dream trip, but there are also many other reasons why this destination is so special. Here are a few:</p>
<p><strong>Rich cultural experiences</strong> Right now, several huge museums are being constructed in the Saadiyat Cultural District, including the <a href="http://www.saadiyatculturaldistrict.ae/en/saadiyat-cultural-district/louvre-abu-dhabi/">Louvre Abu Dhabi</a> &#8211; as a second location for the famous Paris art museum, and the third Guggenheim Museum, which has been designed by Frank Gehry. Abu Dhabi is getting more culturally exciting all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Incredible hotels </strong>Luxury takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to hotels in Abu Dhabi. Things you might consider high-end at hotels in Europe and North America come as standard in Abu Dhabi, and hotels compete to offer the very best and unique perks. These perks include private malls, water parks, spas that go beyond anything you&#8217;ll have experienced anywhere else in the world, dedicated lifestyle consultants, and much more. Also, because hotels are competing to be the best, rates are very competitive so it can feel like you&#8217;re getting quite the bargain compared to what you&#8217;d pay elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>A rich heritage</strong> Abu Dhabi isn&#8217;t just about what&#8217;s new and exciting and imported from elsewhere, it has a rich culture of its own that is easy to access. Want to go out in the desert with a falconry master? Experience a night under the stars on silk cushions listening to traditional music and feasting? There are many wonderful experiences you can take part in that reflect Abu Dhabi&#8217;s history and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping</strong> Yes there are fabulous upscale malls where you can splurge on whatever designer clothes, shoes, bags etc make you happy, but you can also venture out to traditional souks and bazaars to track down authentic local wares to take home. There&#8217;s even a traditional camel market that you can visit &#8211; though that may be a bigger souvenir than you&#8217;d actually want to take home with you!</p>
<p><strong>World class dining</strong> All the luxury that you&#8217;ll find in Abu Dhabi also spills over into the city&#8217;s flourishing restaurant scene. You&#8217;ll find restaurants from the likes of Marco Pierre White and Hakkasan (whose sister restaurant in London is Michelin starred), and all manner of cuisine from South African steakhouses to Chinese inspired to Mediterranean style plates and more. Whatever food you love, you&#8217;ll be happy eating in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p><strong>The nightlife</strong> If you&#8217;re in Abu Dhabi around F1 time, the nightlife there is crazy fun (and of course Skyetrips will get you into the best parties). You&#8217;ll have a chance not only to socialize with the drivers at the Amber Lounge after the race, but also with the many visiting celebrities that head there to celebrate too (in the past this has included the likes of Bono, Naomi Campbell, Liz Hurley, Rod Stewart, and many more).</p>
<p><em>Want to experience Abu Dhabi? Come with us to this year&#8217;s <a title="2015 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix" href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> and we&#8217;ll make sure that you have an incredible time, and see whatever it is that interests you most about this fascinating city.</em></p>

Opened in 2009, Yas Marina Circuit has many stunning and unique features that draw in drivers and spectators alike. Here are 10 of the most interesting facts about this amazing F1 circuit:</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1. Yas Marina Circuit at night </span></h2>
<p>The first Abu Dhabi Grand Prix held at the Yas Marina Circuit had a 5:00 pm start time, the first time in F1 history that a race was held in the dark. The Circuit is not only equipped to hold events at night, but the track can also be sectioned into two tracks to run two races simultaneously.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2. Abu Dhabi race track construction cost</span></h2>
<p>The Yas Marina Circuit is one of the most technologically-advanced racing circuits in the world. It was also the most expensive to build, with an estimated construction cost of US$1 billion. <span id="more-19139"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">3. Yas Marina Circuit facts </span></h2>
<p>The track is 5.55 kilometres (3.45 miles) long, with 21 turns. The average lap time is 1 minute and 40 seconds. Top speeds can reach 317 km/hr with average speeds of 198 km/hr.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">4. Longest F1 track</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit was designed with four main acceleration periods including a 1173 meter acceleration, which is the longest of any F1 track in the world.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5. Yas Marina Circuit pit lane</span></h2>
<p>The pit lane exits cross under the circuit so part of the pit lane is below ground. Drivers have over 70 garages in two pit buildings, making it a superior circuit for drivers.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">6. Best F1 track for spectators</span></h2>
<p>The Yas Marina Circuit can hold up to 50,000 spectators. There are four grandstands in total, and each is covered and shaded to protect race fans from the desert sun. This is the only covered seating F1 circuit, which helps to make it one of the best facilities in the world for spectators.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">7. Abu Dhabi hotel over F1 track</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit features a 12-story, 499 room, luxury resort hotel over the race circuit. The five-star hotel is called the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi Hotel</a> and it forms a bridge over the 18th and 19th turns. The hotel is the first ever built over a F1 circuit.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8. Yas Marina Circuit location </span></h2>
<p>Although only 10 minutes from the airport, the Yas Marina Circuit was built on an island in the United Arab Emirates&#8217; largest city Abu Dhabi, which also happens to the world&#8217;s richest city. Yas is one island of 200 that form the capital.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">9. Yas Marina VIP Sun Tower</span></h2>
<p>The Circuit has a VIP tower that sits at the start/finish line. Called the Sun Tower, it is 60 metres high and affords its guests a luxurious and panoramic view of the entire race track and surrounding features.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">10. Formula Yas 3000 top speed</span></h2>
<p>For hard core race fans, the Circuit also offers drag racing, off-road racing, and a kart center where you can put your own skills to the test. Or, if you prefer, you can attend their driving school and take your turn behind the wheel in a Formula Yas 30000 race car.</p>
<p>For race car enthusiasts, the Yas Marina Circuit offers the cutting edge in race circuit design, F1 racing at its best, and an unparalleled spectator experience. With the World Drivers&#8217; Champion and World Constructors Champions named at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this November, you can be there to experience the action live. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact us</a> to book your trip now with Skyetrips!</p>

You can be there on race day to see who takes the checkered flag by booking a customized sports travel trip through <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyetrips</a>.</p>
<p>As a race car fan, the likely place to start is with your itinerary is with the races. You can choose to attend the practice sessions on Friday, the qualifying sessions on Saturday, and the F1 circuit race on Sunday. If you choose all three race days, plan to arrive Thursday and leave Monday. Or, just attend race day, it&#8217;s entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Once you do decide on the dates to attend the United States Grand Prix 2014, then Skyetrips will book your flight be it economy, first class, or private jet. Transportation from your home to the airport, and airport to hotel will of course be arranged for you.<span id="more-19135"></span></p>
<p>Your Grand Prix experience wouldn&#8217;t be yours if you didn&#8217;t choose your seating too. Skyetrips has four incredible<a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> seating packages</a> for you to choose from. Each package of Sunday tickets corresponds to one of four grandstands, each of which is located at a strategic turn alongside the 3.4 mile Circuit of the Americas race track.</p>
<p>One of the spectators&#8217; favorite grandstands is located at the spectacular corner of Turn 1. To reach Turn 1 from the start, drivers accelerate up a 133 foot hill then must negotiate an immediate, and blind, left turn. It is a true thrill to watch.</p>
<p>Turn 1 is the spot for hard core enthusiasts because the turns can be so harrowing to watch and are second to none on the F1 circuit. Fortunately for you, Skyetrips&#8217; <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn 1 Hospitality Suite</a> overlooks that corner. You can enjoy drinks, food, and a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the race cars arriving all from the comfort of this private balcony.</p>
<p>With race day action at the United States Grand Prix 2014 planned, customize the rest of your trip by taking full advantage of Skyetrips&#8217; considerable knowledge of Austin-area events and nightlife, and concierge services.</p>
<p>Skyetrips will make reservations at your choice of <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end Austin hotels</a>, the W Hotel Austin or the Hyatt Place Austin Downtown. These award winning hotels are within walking distance of many nightlife attractions, but you also have the option of hiring a private car throughout your stay to drive you out in the evening, as well as to and from the race track.</p>
