Over the last decade, we’ve seen a number of inventive and sophisticated eateries popping up around the city, joining some beloved Augusta classics. The result is a variety of memorable dining experiences for visitors to take advantage of.</p>
<p>We understand how much great meals can add to a travel experience. Discovering remarkable food is one of our favorite things about traveling and we’ve spent plenty of time scouting out some great options for our Masters guests.</p>
<p>After many visits to Augusta and years of delicious research, we’ve listed some of our top Augusta restaurant recommendations below. The diverse list includes options to please virtually any palate. If you’re traveling to the Masters with us, your pre-travel personal concierge would be happy to help out with some custom recommendations based on your tastes.</p>
<h3>Downtown</h3>
<h2>Frog Hollow Tavern</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49883" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.6906</strong><br />
www.froghollowtavern.com<br />
Simply put, it’s one of the best in the city. They just seem to do everything right. The<br />
focus on service is as important as the quality of the food, creating an ideal farm-to-table dining experience. The menu changes seasonally so it’s a new experience every year. There’s an impressive wine list too if you’re so inclined. This is the place to go in Augusta, you’ll need to make reservations well in advance.</p>
<h2>Farmhaus Burger</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49886" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8771</strong><br />
www.farmhausburger.com<br />
This isn’t your average burger. A sister restaurant to Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus serves up gourmet burgers made from locally-sourced ingredients. Agonize over which delicious option to choose from or create your own. Whatever you decide on, we recommend pairing it with the housemade sweet potato tots. Fun, casual, and they even have gluten free options. There is a second location in Flowing Wells.</p>
<h2>Craft &#038; Vine</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49888" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8442</strong><br />
craftandvine.com<br />
The third member of the Frog Hollow Tavern family is Craft &#038; Vine. This downtown cocktail bar serves up flavorful small plates and wood-fired pizzas. Open late, it’s a great place for a nightcap; sip on a handcrafted cocktail or a great glass of wine while<br />
reminiscing about a great day of golf.</p>
<h2>The Boll Weevil Café</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49889" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.722.7772</strong><br />
www.thebollweevil.com<br />
Ask anyone in Augusta where to go for dessert and you’ll likely be directed to the Boll Weevil. Yes, they offer lunch and dinner as well but the long list of sweet treats are the highlight. We’d recommend our favorite dessert but it’s impossible to pick just one. Its proximity to the Riverwalk makes it a nice spot for a refreshment if you’re in the area.</p>
<h3>Surrey Center</h3>
<h2>Calvert’s</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49890" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.4514</strong><br />
calvertsrestaurant.net<br />
Calvert’s is the reigning fine dining choice in Augusta. A long time favorite of both our<br />
clients and our staff, it’s the best place in town for steak and seafood. The service is<br />
impeccable, the food is superb, and the wine list is the best in the city. Calvert’s is an<br />
Augusta landmark; you’ll need to make reservations well ahead for this one, particularly<br />
for Masters week.</p>
<h2>Finch &#038; Fifth</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49891" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.5300</strong><br />
www.finchandfifth.com<br />
Augusta has been blessed with a number of creative new restaurants in the last decade<br />
and Finch &#038; Fifth is one of them. The dishes are mostly modern takes on Southern<br />
classics and there’s also a charcuterie and cheese menu. Good food and drink, friendly,<br />
unpretentious.</p>
<h2>Abel Brown Southern Kitchen &#038; Oyster Bar</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49892" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.6491</strong><br />
www.abelbrownaugusta.com<br />
Chef Todd Schafer has been a staple on the Augusta restaurant scene for many years<br />
and Abel Brown is his latest venture. The oysters are excellent but so is everything else<br />
we’ve tried. We think it’s well-deserving of the phenomenal reviews it’s received over<br />
the years.</p>
<h2>Oliviana</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49893" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-723-1242</strong><br />
www.olivianaitaliano.com<br />
This great eatery boasts some of our favorite pizza in Augusta. If you’re not in the mood<br />
for pizza, Oliviana’s Italian menu is extensive and you’re sure to find something that will<br />
make your mouth water. Small and intimate, Oliviana’s atmosphere is as enjoyable as<br />
the food. They’re open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.</p>
<h3>Village West</h3>
<h2>Edgar’s Grille</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49894" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-854-4700</strong><br />
www.edgarsgrille.com<br />
Edgar’s serves up New American cuisine with a southern flair and their farm-to-table<br />
dishes are wonderful. Whatever dish piques your interest, be sure to complement it<br />
with a side of truffle fries. Edgar’s Grille is one of our favorites and it’s more than just<br />
a restaurant. It’s also a training center for culinary students at Helms College. The<br />
restaurant gives back a portion of their profits toward local education programs, in case<br />
you needed another great reason to eat here.</p>
<h2>Cork &#038; Flame</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49887" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-922-9463</strong><br />
www.corkandflame.com<br />
Cork &#038; Flame combines fine dining, small bites, and one of the largest wine<br />
selections in the area with close to 3,000 labels. The dining room offers self-described<br />
“Progressive American Cuisine,” which can be enjoyed a la carte, as part of a fourcourse tasting menu, or as the eight-course chef’s table experience. The Cork &#038; Flame<br />
also has a fairly extensive vegetarian menu, making it a great option for plant-based<br />
eaters.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Masters week is a busy week for restaurants in Augusta and we recommend making reservations well in advance (think months, not weeks) to avoid missing out. It’s important to note that many restaurants have strict reservation policies for this particular week. Augusta has some amazing restaurants and we hope you’ll enjoy trying them out as much as we have. </p>

Some of its traditions are well known, others not so much. Many of the questions we get from our <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/masters/">Masters</a> guests are about how to get the most out of their visit, including how to navigate its celebrated customs and traditions. We’ve learned a lot from our many visits to Augusta and have compiled some information to help all of those who hope to experience this iconic tournament one day.</p>
<h2>The Merch</h2>
<p>Official Masters merchandise is only available at Augusta National during Masters week. The question isn’t whether you will buy something, it’s when and how much. No doubt you’ll have a long list of requests from friends and family but when to buy it all will require some careful planning. Buy it too early and you’ll be lugging it around with you all day. Buy it too late in the tournament and you’ll find little selection left. It’s a fine line and the struggle is real. Your brother-in-law and your friends at the club are counting on you.</p>
<h2>The Food</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg" alt="masters pimento cheese sandwich" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47603" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Most first time visitors are shocked at the food and drink prices at Augusta National. Not because they’re so high, because they are so wildly inexpensive. You’ll feel like you’re in a different era. Where else in the world of sport can you grab a beer and one of those famous pillowy soft pimento cheese sandwiches for just $5.50?</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Chairs</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg" alt="masters chairs" width="300" height="158" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47605" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want to sit down somewhere other than the grandstands on Augusta National, you’ll want to purchase or bring along a chair (but you’ll need to make sure it’s collapsible and doesn’t have armrests – Augusta National is strict with their rules). We definitely recommend buying a Masters chair; few things are more fun than showing up at a summer event and nonchalantly putting down your green Masters-logoed chair. “Oh yeah, that’s right, I did go the Masters this year.” Spots are first come, first serve. Many patrons (as you’ve likely noticed on TV, Masters attendees are referred to as patrons, never fans) will claim their spot early in the day and come and go as they please. There’s no need to worry about someone taking your chair or spot, that’s simply unheard of at this event and one of the many joys of the Masters. If you plan to plant a chair on Sunday for the lucky golfer’s emotional walk up 18, you will need to be there very early. It’s coveted real estate on Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>As with anything related to the great game of golf, it is important to know the rules. Masters patrons are keen observers of the etiquette and rules of this well-heeled event. Don’t worry, before you go we’ll send you a complete list of items that you can and can’t bring with you, like no phones or cameras after the practice rounds conclude. So for now, politeness rules the day, decorum is the modus operandi, and make sure your golf outfit is properly matched. </p>
<h2>The Souvenir Photo</h2>
<p>You know how they say you can’t get a picture during the Masters? Well, that’s not entirely true. To be clear, we are not recommending flouting the very serious rule about cameras. Instead, as you are making your way towards the Par 3 Course, you will likely see a line forming near the first hole. This is the picture line. Right near Founders Circle the Club will take your picture with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background. After they have taken your picture, they will give you a small plastic card that will allow you to retrieve the picture online later. Apart from the time spent, it won’t cost you a thing. </p>
<h2>The Big Decision</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg" alt="augusta masters field" width="300" height="179" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47606" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-1024x612.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-768x459.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For many people the highlight of the tournament is watching the last few deciding holes on Sunday afternoon. The anticipation and excitement is there and the whole week often comes down to the back nine at Augusta. While most patrons want to stay to experience this live, it makes for a challenge to find a good spot to view the action from. In fact, many patrons will leave early and head to a hospitality venue or somewhere else where they can watch the action on TV to guarantee themselves a great view. Should you stay or should you go? It’s something you may want to think about before Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Hospitality</h2>
<p>To do hospitality or not do hospitality, that is the question. This is something that is very much personal preference and another unique aspect that makes Augusta special. Unlike any other golf event, there is no hospitality on the course at Augusta National. This has created a variety of offsite hospitality venues, each with their own strengths. Skyetrips partners with the most solid hospitality providers and we can match you with the most well suited option. </p>
<h2>The Extensions</h2>
<p>After a few days on a golf high, we know first hand how hard it is to head back to real life. Instead, many of our clients choose to extend their trip with a few extra days in Hilton Head, Savannah, or a number of other golf destinations in the area.</p>

It’s widely considered to be the most prestigious golf tournament and each year, thousands flock to Augusta National Golf Club to witness this historic event. The Masters is steeped in history and tradition, including its own set of rules and customs. We’ve complied some of our best Masters etiquette tips to enable you to fully enjoy the tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>No phones or cameras</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46703 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-300x169.jpg" alt="masters phone not allowed" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the most talked about rules at the Masters is the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-masters-cellphones-banned-augusta-national-20190410-story.html">ban on phones</a> and cameras. It’s one of the few places in today’s world where everyone is unplugged.</p>
<p>Even without your phone or camera, there are still a few ways to get pictures at the Masters. Cameras are permitted for the practice rounds so you are able to snap as many pics as you like those days. For the tournament rounds, there is a picture line near the first hole where the club will take a picture of you with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background.</p>
<p>If you do need to make a phone call while you’re at the tournament, there are plenty of public phones on the course. Enjoy the rare opportunity to take a break from being available 24/7.</p>
<h2><strong>Leaving chairs on the course </strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46704 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-300x158.jpg" alt="masters golf chairs" width="300" height="158" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For your visit to the Masters, you are permitted to bring your own chair provided it is collapsible and does not have armrests. If you don’t have one that fits the requirements, you can purchase an official Masters golf chair at the tournament, which also happens to make a great souvenir.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Masters week is that once you pick your preferred spot to place your chair, you can leave it there for the day and not worry about someone taking the chair or your spot. It’s pretty much unheard of at the Masters and one of the tournament’s many joys.</p>
<h2><strong>Referring to guests as patrons</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve watched the Masters on TV, you’ll notice that fans on the course are almost always referred to as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/sports/golf/masters-no-fans-patrons.html">patrons</a>.” This tradition is attributed to Clifford Roberts, co-founder of Augusta National Golf Club, who strived to provide a more distinguished experience for spectators. The term dates back to the beginning of the tournament in 1934.</p>
<h2><strong>Prohibited items</strong></h2>
<p>There are a number of items prohibited at The Masters tournament. In addition to phones and cameras, no electronic devices are allowed on the course. Other prohibited items include flags, banners, signs, food and drink, and bags larger than 10” x 10” x 12”. A complete list of Masters prohibited items can be found on our <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/luxury-travel-guides/masters-tips/">Masters Tournament Tips and FAQS.</a></p>
<h2><strong>What to wear</strong></h2>
<p>At the Masters, most patrons dress in “golf casual” attire including collared shirts and long pants or golf shorts. We recommend to dress like you are playing. Keep in mind there are a couple of items that are not permitted to wear at the Masters: denim (jeans) and golf shoes with metal spikes. If you are wearing a hat, be sure not to wear it backwards.</p>
<h2><strong>Autographs</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-46705" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-300x200.jpg" alt="par3 autograph masters augusta" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-scaled.jpg 1597w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you’re hoping to snag an autograph or two from the pros, your best bet is the Par 3 tournament on the Wednesday of Masters week. The atmosphere is a little more relaxed and the players are more likely to engage with fans. Other than that, the only other place autographs are permitted is at the practice range. Autographs are prohibited anywhere on the course during the Masters tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>Children and babies</strong></h2>
<p>Children and babies are permitted at the Masters, though they are expected to follow the rules and exhibit appropriate behavior. Guardians are considered responsible for their child’s behavior and may be asked to leave if it becomes disruptive. Strollers are not permitted at Augusta National.</p>
<h2><strong>Weather warning/inclement weather </strong></h2>
<p>In the unlikely event of inclement weather, pay attention to the scoreboards and message boards for the tournament’s weather warning sign. If this appears, for everyone’s safety you are expected to seek shelter nearby and avoid risky areas including bodies of water, isolated trees, open areas, grandstands and wire fences.</p>
<h2><strong>Two gate entries per day</strong></h2>
<p>Patrons are not permitted more than two gate entries per day, or in other words, you can leave the club only once after you have been admitted. But really, once you’ve arrived on the hallowed grounds of Augusta National, why would you want to leave?</p>
<h2><strong>No animals other than service animals</strong></h2>
<p>This one is fairly common sense but don’t plan on bringing your pet to witness the golf action. Service animals are permitted.</p>
<h2><strong>Quiet</strong></h2>
<p>Be quiet during play. While the norm at some sporting events involves shouting and making noise, the Masters is not one of them.</p>
<h2><strong>Walk, don’t run</strong></h2>
<p>Running is not permitted anywhere on the course. As patrons move from hole to hole, you’ll notice plenty of people speed walking, but no running.</p>
<h2><strong>Stay behind the ropes</strong></h2>
<p>At the Masters, there are ropes blocking areas where patrons are not permitted. This rule applies whether there are players in the area or not. Never go under the ropes and be sure to use the marked crosswalks to get around.</p>
<h2><strong>No napping</strong></h2>
<p>As tempting as the plush green grass of Augusta National is, refrain from laying down for a rest, and from taking off your shoes at any point.</p>
<h2><strong>Leave the course as you found it</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26538" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg" alt="masters tips" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Augusta National is one of the most pristine courses you’ll ever see and it is expected that patrons will help keep it that way. Be respectful, don’t litter, and don’t help yourself to a souvenir; in 2012, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/augusta-national-sand-stealer-arrest-cost-2019-4">a patron was arrested</a> for trying to take sand from the course as a memento.</p>
<h2><strong>Be on your best behavior</strong></h2>
<p>Like most professional golf tournaments, proper decorum is rule of the day. So bring your best manners with you, make sure you follow the expectations and you’re sure to have the experience of a lifetime.</p>

One of the most popular sports in the world &#8211; and for good reason. Accessible at any age, there’s a real joy in playing a leisurely round or two on a beautiful, lush course when the weather is fine. It’s a pastime that has been enjoyed for centuries, from professional to amateur, from Royalty to the common man/woman, a love affair that shows no signs of waning any time soon. But perhaps one of the real beauties of the game is that it also makes for the perfect vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golf and travel go hand in hand, at once providing the opportunity to explore some of the world’s most stunning destinations while giving you a chance to up your handicap. But whether you’re playing or watching, here are some of the world’s best golf trip destinations &#8211; with a dash of luxury thrown in. So, tick all these off best golf trips in the world off your golfing bucket list &#8211; because you deserve it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best golf trip ideas for your bucket list</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#scotland">The Old Course &#8211; St. Andrews &#8211; Scotland</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#northernireland">The British Open &#8211; Portrush &#8211; Northern Ireland</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#california">The US Open &#8211; Pebble Beach &#8211; California</a></strong></li>

<li><strong><a href="#puertorico">Royal Isabela &#8211; Puerto Rico</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#australia">Royal Melbourne &#8211; Victoria &#8211; Australia</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="scotland"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">The Old Course &#8211; St. Andrews &#8211; Scotland</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bit of a no brainer this one &#8211; no golf vacations list would be complete without including a trip to the home of the sport. It was here sometime in the 15th century that our (fore)fathers began to develop the game we know and love today. The Old Course in St. Andrews on the east coast of Scotland is home to the prestigious Royal and Ancient Golf Club, the oldest of its kind in the world, founded in 1754. There are no less than six beautiful and challenging courses here, but the highlight is undoubtedly the famous double greens and Swilcan Bridge &#8211; a 700-year-old golfing Mecca.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31232" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31232" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31232 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course.jpg" alt="Old Course, St Andrews Golf Course" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course.jpg 640w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31232" class="wp-caption-text">Iconic.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>Old Course, &#8220;<a href="https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5347500">Old Course, St Andrews</a>&#8221; by G Laird is licensed under CC BY 2.0</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after a day enjoying the fineries that you can experience on the green, St. Andrews is an ancient delight, known for its Cathedral, the ruins of St. Andrews Castle, and &#8211; of course &#8211; the excellent British Golf Museum &#8211; which no true fan should miss. Scotland has recently been voted the most beautiful country in the world, so it’s the perfect time to enjoy a golf trip to these shores. Their traditional fish and chips are the best in the British Isles, too.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2 id="northernireland"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">The British Open &#8211; Portrush &#8211; Northern Ireland</span>  </span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in the UK we move across to Northern Ireland’s beautiful Portrush course, home of this year’s British Open. The Dunluce Links are up there with the most challenging in the world, named after the ruined Dunluce Castle that overlooks the green. Right on the wild, rugged, Northern Irish coast, players will be battling with the elements as much as they are against each other. In 2007, </span><a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/100greatestinternational" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golf Digest ranked it as the fourth best course outside of the US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31233" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31233" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31233 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Giants-Causway.jpg" alt="Giants Causeway Northern Ireland " width="747" height="471" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Giants-Causway.jpg 747w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Giants-Causway-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31233" class="wp-caption-text">The nearby Giant’s Causeway.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portrush itself is a charming seaside town built out along a peninsula, itself a popular holiday destination, with beautiful beaches to keep you entertained when not watching the pros duke it out for the Claret Jug. But Belfast should be your base, a town steeped in maritime history, not least as the birthplace of the RMS Titanic.</span><a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/british-open/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A travel package to the British Open</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year promises to be every bit as dramatic as the landscape that welcomes it.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2 id="california"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">The US Open &#8211; Pebble Beach &#8211; California</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most iconic of all stateside courses, Pebble Beach is a by-word for golf trip excellence. It has hosted the thrilling </span><a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/us-open-golf/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Open</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no less than five times, with the sixth arriving this year. As far as coastal courses go, few would argue its pedigree, proudly sitting above the crashing waters of the Pacific below. Every hole is a dream, but it boasts the most incredible vistas from the 7th and 8th. As Jack Nicklaus said, “</span><a href="https://www.pebblebeach.com/golf/quotes-from-pros-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had only one more round to play, I would choose to play it at Pebble Beach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” High praise indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monterey is home to 20 courses, all within swinging distance of one another. And there’s no denying the stunning beauty of the landscape that encompasses them. The famous Highway 101 down through Big Sur is one of the best drives on the planet, with some truly memorable viewpoints along this particular 17-mile stretch. And with the US Open landing on Father’s Day weekend this year, there’s no better time to book one of the best golf trips for guys</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">money can buy. This is just a different class.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2 id="georgia"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">The Masters &#8211; Augusta National &#8211; Georgia</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This clash of the titans is the only major tournament to be held on the same course each year. Since 1934, the best of the best battle for the coveted green jacket over links designed by founder Bobby Jones and the great golf course architect Dr. Alister MacKenzie. It has been extended and improved significantly over the years to keep it a consistent challenge. A former plant nursery, every hole is named after a tree or shrub, giving you an indication of just how gorgeous this vividly emerald course is. As bucket list golf trips go, it certainly needs to be tee’d off.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31235" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31235" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31235 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/masters-hero7.jpg" alt="Masters, Augusta National" width="747" height="471" /><p id="caption-attachment-31235" class="wp-caption-text">Teeing off at another Masters.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course is situated in the heart of Augusta, the old stomping ground of soul legend James Brown, and the Museum of History has exhibits dedicated to both him and golf. This leafy town has real southern charm, with a late evening stroll along the breathtaking Savannah River a particular highlight. There’s still plenty to see and do here for all the family over this four-day contest, making </span><a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/masters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Masters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the best golf vacation destinations around.  </span></p>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2 id="newyork"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">PGA Championship &#8211; Bethpage Black Course &#8211; New York</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just around the corner in May, the 101st </span><a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/pga-championship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PGA Championship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finds its way to the most challenging of all Bethpage State Park’s courses &#8211; the Black. Opening back in 1936 and located on Long Island, this green has grown into a very demanding 18, famous as a driver’s course because of its long fairways. Designed by US golf architect A.W. Tillinghast, it rightly gets considerable praise from golfing greats, particularly as it’s accessible to the public yet maintains its quality as much as any exclusive club. Its PGA debut is set to be a memorable experience for all attending.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31237" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31237" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31237 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York.jpg" alt="Statue of Liberty New York" width="747" height="471" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York.jpg 747w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31237" class="wp-caption-text">Lady Liberty at sunset.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to golf trip ideas, adding a city like New York into the mix has the potential to offer some truly world-class hospitality. You’ll never be short of anything to see or do in the Big Apple when taking some downtime from the action. Take in a show on Broadway, enjoy a birds-eye view from the Empire State, or people watch at Times Square. The city is filled with golfing stores too, making it one of the best places for golf trips if you really want to treat yourself.</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2 id="puertorico"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">Royal Isabela &#8211; Puerto Rico</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to go too far if you’re looking for a bit of tropical golf. Puerto Rico is home to some really good quality courses &#8211; Perhaps the best being the stunning, coastal Royal Isabela club. Located on the northwest coast, its 426 acres of Atlantic views and pristine greens, all set within one of the most decadent and luxurious resorts on the island. With a year-round temperate climate, Puerto Rico is a golfing paradise &#8211; and Royal Isabela the jewel in the crown. It&#8217;s challenging, 73 par round will enthrall you, even if the coastal conditions embarrass your game.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31238" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31238" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31238 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Golf-at-Sunset.jpg" alt="Golf at Sunset" width="747" height="471" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Golf-at-Sunset.jpg 747w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Golf-at-Sunset-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31238" class="wp-caption-text">Glorious weather awaits.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But apart from the sumptuous surroundings and 5-star accommodation, what makes Puerto Rico one of the best golf vacation destinations is the price. Certainly compared to some of the aforementioned courses, you can live like a king or queen here for a fraction of the cost. And in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017, resorts are extensively rebuilding, eager to once again attract golf fans from all over the world. There’s no better time to enjoy this bucket list golf trip than now.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2 id="australia"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;">Royal Melbourne &#8211; Victoria &#8211; Australia</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another course by the indubitable Mackenzie, the Royal Melbourne Club is Australia’s premier golf trip destination. Located in a region known as the Sandbelt, the soil has made it particularly easy to place bunkers wherever an architect desires. As you might expect in the Scottish-Yorkshireman’s deft hands, he has created an experience quite unlike any other. The sheer variety here will keep your game in check &#8211; particularly with approach shots and an abundance of tricky hazards. You’ll need to be a member of an overseas club to play through though.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_31239" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31239" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31239 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Melbourne-Austrailia.jpg" alt="Melbourne Austrailia" width="747" height="471" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Melbourne-Austrailia.jpg 747w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Melbourne-Austrailia-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31239" class="wp-caption-text">The stunning Melbourne coast.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as luck would have it, this coming December sees the return of the President’s Cup to Australia’s finest course, where an international team (minus Europe) takes on a team from the US. And with the wintery weather setting in throughout the northern hemisphere, it’s a perfect choice for a bucket list golf vacation this year. A holiday down under is just what Dr. Mackenzie ordered.</span></p>

The difference between The Masters and other major championships is that it is held each year at the same location, which is the fantastic Augusta National Golf Club. The project was initiated by Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones, who designed Augusta National with golf course architect Alister MacKenzie. Today, The Masters Golf Course is known throughout the world but it was not always so popular.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">10 Fun Facts about the Masters Golf Tournament:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>The club couldn’t afford to pay the first winner of the Masters in 1934, who was Horton Smith. They could not pay any of the top finishers until some 17 club members chipped in for the purse. The financial hardships of the club are legendary as it was founded at the beginning of the Great Depression, which was followed by WWII. At the time, they only had 74 paying members instead of the 1,800 they had planned for.</li>
<li>Alister MacKenzie, the world reputed golf course designer, died before the course’s grass had been planted. Despite his dedication and ambition to play on Augusta National, he never did play or see the course in its finished form.</li>
<li>The Masters Golf Course was first planned as a 19 hole course as per the request of Bobby Jones, one of the founders of Augusta National. However, the idea was dropped not only because of economic reasons but also because the 19th hole would impede the view to the 18th green for patrons watching The Masters. The 19th hole was to give another opportunity to the losing golfer to win back his money in a game of double or nothing.</li>
<li>The green jacket, now an icon of the tournament itself, was not meant to be awarded to the Masters winner but was intended as an usher’s coat. Members of the club would wear the green jacket to help fans in attendance spot them easily in case they needed to ask questions. The first time the jackets were worn by golfers was in 1937.</li>
<li>During World War II, Augusta National was forced to close in 1942. Instead of glamorous tournaments, the Masters Golf Course accommodated cattle and turkey to make money. However, despite the profits on the turkeys, the project barely broke even. The Masters Golf Course was then reopened in 1944.</li>
<li>The first person who coined the term “The Masters” was Clifford Roberts. He first used it in 1938 and the name was adopted in 1939. The tournament was originally known as the Augusta National Invitational Tournament. Bobby Jones was never a fan of The Masters name and used to refer to the tournament as “the so-called Masters.”</li>
<li>Augusta National was not the founders’ first choice for the tournament. In fact, they originally petitioned the USGA to host the 1934 US Open, but they were rejected. The tournament was therefore listed unnamed for the first time in a brief note in the PGA 1934 schedule.</li>
<li>One of Augusta’s famous landmarks is Ike’s Pond, located on holes 8 and 9 of the Par 3 course. The pond was named after Dwight Eisenhower, who made the suggestion to add a pond on the property.</li>
<li>It seems hard to believe now, but prior to 1982 players at the Masters were not permitted to use their own caddies. Instead, the club assigned each pro a local caddy who knew the course well. The decision to allow players to use their own caddies ended this 46-year tradition.</li>
<li>There are three bridges on Augusta National and they are all named after someone special to the course. Hogan Bridge, which leads to the 12th green is “to commemorate Ben Hogan’s record score for four rounds of 274 in 1953.” Nelson Bridge, between the 12th and 13th holes, is a tribute to Byron Nelson, who launched an impressive comeback on those same holes in the 1937 Masters tournament. And Sarazen Bridge on hole 15 was named for Gene Sarazen, who scored a 2 on this par 5 hole in the 1935 Masters.</li>

<p><strong>Notable British Open Golf Courses</strong></p>
<p>The sport of golf has enjoyed many a moment in the sun. The trouble is unless you’re well-versed in the sport; very few of you know these iconic courses by name.</p>
<p>The top five must-see British Open Golf Courses are listed below. As a bonus, both their actual designation and their notable designation are included to help you remember the course particulars:<span id="more-19190"></span></p>
<p><strong>Course #1: </strong><em><strong>That place where golf was invented. </strong></em><strong>Officially known as: Muirfield Golf Course, Scotland</strong></p>
<p>While St. Andrews <strong><em>is</em></strong> widely known as “the home of golf” (more on that later), this course is the real birthplace of the sport. The <em>Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers</em> sat at these tables and wrote down the first rules of golf. To this day, you can sit at the community tables alongside members and connect with the very roots of the sport.</p>
<p>Many visitors enjoy a full day of golfing complete with an all-world lunch. The course itself remains a true test of golf; being consistently rated among the top ten in the world. Just remember gentlemen, a jacket is still an on-course requirement, so don’t leave home without it.</p>
<p><strong>Course #2: </strong><em><strong>That place where Tiger Woods cried.</strong></em><strong> Officially known as: Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Merseyside, England</strong></p>
<p>This course has hosted the British Open at least a dozen times. In addition to Woods’ emotional performance in 2006-winning the title just two months after his father’s death, this course also hosted the first competition between Great Britain and the United States in 1921.</p>
<p><strong>Course #3: </strong><em><strong>That place where Donald Trump laid claim to a piece of golfing history. </strong></em><strong> Officially known as: Alisa Course, Turnberry Resort, Scotland</strong></p>
<p>True, Donald Trump may own the course now, but this four-time British Open host has an even bigger claim to fame.  In 1977, Tom Watson beat golf legend Jack Nicklaus on this very course.  The showdown became known as the “Duel in the Sun.”  Watson tried to repeat his victory 32 years later against another opponent, but his single-shot triumph over Nicklaus would never be duplicated.</p>
<p>If you want to walk the cliffs like the golfing greats of both past and present; the good news is, as far as British Open Golf Courses go, this one is relatively easy to secure a tee time at. Beware of the windy back nine and the resort-like atmosphere; no old school club experience here.</p>
<p><strong>Course #4: </strong><em><strong>That place with the odd-looking clubhouse. </strong></em><strong>Officially known as: Royal Birkdale, England</strong></p>
<p>The art-decoclubhouse may be its signature, but golfers count it among their favorite stops because there’s not a weak hole in the entire layout. This nine-time British Open host has proven to be worth its salt.</p>
<p><strong>Course #5: </strong><em><strong>That place known as the home of golf. </strong></em><strong>Officially known as: The Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland</strong></p>
<p>Our list has brought us full circle to this year’s host. Once about every five years, the British Open returns to this historic course, where 5 golfing greats have won two titles each; it&#8217;s a sight to behold. And yes, you too can play here!</p>
<p>This is a mere glimpse of the wonders British Open Golf Courses hold. To books your own British Open golf tour, <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/british-open-packages/">contact us</a> at Roadtrips and let us know what legendary course you want to visit first.</p>

Located in the north of England, the city of Liverpool sits on the River Mersey and is the fourth largest city in the country. Once an impressive port, Liverpool is also known for its friendly and hospitable residents and their fabulous sense of humor.</p>
<p>However, it was The Beatles that brought fame to the city of Liverpool. Here, you can see historic Beatles sites like Penny Lane, Strawberry Field, and take a Magical Mystery Tour. So, apart from its connection to this unique band, what are some of the other great attractions of Liverpool?</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>St. George’s Hall</b> &#8211; You can’t possibly visit Liverpool and not see St. George’s Hall with its gardens to the rear and plateau to the front. A neoclassical grade 1 building, St. George’s Hall is the number one Liverpool attraction and your trip to the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/british-open-packages/"><b>2014 British Open</b></a> is the perfect opportunity to walk around this lovely building. Take this chance to see the extraordinary organ built by Henry Willis and also the unique mosaic floor made from Minton tiles.</li>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Walker Art Collection</b> &#8211; A trip to Liverpool must include a visit to one of the biggest art collections outside of London, the Walker Art Collection. The collection began in 1819 with 37 paintings pertaining to the personal collection of William Roscoe, who was forced to sell them after his bank failed. The Walker Art Collection is an impressive blend of magnificent works by Rembrandt, Degas, as well as David Hockney, Lucien Freud, and Banksy.<span id="more-19095"></span></li>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Hope Street</b> &#8211; Few places have deserved more their name than Hope Street in Liverpool, featuring the Catholic Cathedral at one end and the Anglican Cathedral at the other. If you decide to let your passion for golf drive you to the 2014 British Open in Liverpool, make sure you take a stroll down Hope Street and listen to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra or visit the famous men toilets at the Philharmonic Pub.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">

<li><b>Pier Head</b> &#8211; There is probably no other sight in Liverpool as astounding as the Pier Head, a World Heritage Site. You can visit the three world-famous graces, which are The Liver Building, the Cunard Building, and The Port of Liverpool Building, but you can also see the many exhibitions in the newly added Liverpool Museum.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Albert Dock</b> &#8211; A wonderfully renovated place, the Albert Dock is now a shopping parade with The Tate Liverpool and cozy restaurants. The home of the Maritime Museum, the Albert Dock is one of the most popular attractions in Liverpool and is used for the Tall Ships regatta. The area is also known for its diverse and active nightlife with fashionable restaurants and bars.</li>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Speke Hall</b> – While in town for the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/trip/british-open-packages/"><b>2014 British Open</b></a> visit one of the oldest remaining buildings in Liverpool, which is Speke Hall. This historic site’s roots go back as far as the Tudors. During the reformation, a priest’s hole was used to hide members of the clergy. Don’t miss a meeting with the ghost of Mary Norris, who haunts the building remorseful about killing her young son.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>The Cavern Club</b> &#8211; A nightclub that was originally opened in 1957, the Cavern Club is known as the center of the music scene in the 1960s. The Beatles have placed The Cavern Club securely on the world map and you simply have to visit to this amazing piece of rock and roll history.</li>
