This picturesque country has planned an ideal setup for the tournament. With all the stadiums clustered within a small radius, it allows guests to maximize their time in Qatar, whether it be taking in matches or exploring the beauty of this world-class destination.</p>
<h3>Qatar Travel Tips</h3>
<p>Wondering what to expect during your visit to Qatar for the World Cup? Our staff has made multiple visits to Qatar in preparation for the event, each time discovering more about the country. Below we’ve detailed what we’ve learned about Qatar and its culture to help you plan your trip and enjoy your visit.</p>
<h3>All About Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49527" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a fascinating destination and the 2022 World Cup is the perfect reason to travel to this dynamic, thriving country. Qatar, and specifically its capital Doha, offers a wonderful blend of stunning, ultramodern high rises and 100-year-old cultural heritage sites, an enchanting mix of old and new. Plus, there are so many memorable experiences for visitors within a few hours’ drive of the capital. You can read about some of our top recommendations in our blog <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/things-to-see-and-do-in-doha-during-the-2022-world-cup/">“Things to See and Do in Doha During the 2022 World Cup.”</a></p>
<h3>During your Visit</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49529" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We think our guests will immediately feel comfortable in Qatar. The people are friendly and welcoming. Crime is incredibly rare, and in fact, Doha was recently named <a href="https://www.luxurytravelmagazine.com/news-articles/doha-ranks-second-safest-city-in-the-world">one of the safest cities in the world</a>. English is widely spoken, largely due Doha’s sizable expat population. Much of the signage around the city is in English, which makes getting around and communicating a breeze compared to other foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Dining in Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-31380" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg" alt="La Mar Doha" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar.jpg 715w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of our favorite things about Qatar is the food. Doha has some wonderful world-class eateries including big names like Hakkasan, Nobu and Morimoto. The list of notable restaurants is long and we’ve enjoyed trying out as many as we can. So much so that we wrote a whole blog about it <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/best-restaurants-in-doha-for-the-2022-world-cup/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>Those wondering about Qatar’s alcohol policy and whether they’ll be able to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner will be happy to know the answer is yes. In fact, there are many famous bars and restaurants — primarily in hotels — that serve the same handcrafted cocktails you’d find in other global travel hot spots.</p>
<h3>Tipping</h3>
<p>While tipping is not a traditional practice in Qatar, it has become more common due to the large expat population. Often a service charge will be included on your bill when dining out. If not, a tip at your discretion is usually appreciated.</p>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28694" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We are very particular about hotels and fortunately Qatar has some wonderful options from intimate boutique-style properties to five-star beach resorts. Our World Cup guests have access to some of the best hotels in the country including the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">Ritz-Carlton Doha</a> and the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">St. Regis Doha</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting Around Qatar for the World Cup</h3>
<p>Doha is in the process of completing a state-of-the-art rapid transit system (Doha Metro) that is being lauded as one of the most advanced rail transportation systems in the world. Complete with first-class sections (called Gold Club), Doha Metro’s modern trains can transport passengers up to 100km/h, bypassing bad traffic. With a system designed specifically for the tournament, the Doha Metro will be the most efficient way to traverse the city and access the stadiums during the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<h3>Weather in Qatar</h3>
<p>World Cup organizers have meticulously planned the event to ensure that players and spectators can enjoy comfortable weather during the tournament. The 2022 World Cup was moved from its traditional summer dates to Qatar’s winter in order to take advantage of the more enjoyable temperatures. The 2022 World Cup will take place from November 21 to December 18, when temperatures average 68-86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30°C). In addition, all the World Cup host stadiums have been constructed with cooling systems.</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49487" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a conservative country and you’ll find many of the locals dressed in traditional clothing. While visitors are not expected to dress in the same manner, it is recommended to be sensitive to their culture by dressing modestly. This includes keeping shoulders, upper arms and knees covered. Swimwear is acceptable on the beach or by the pool.</p>
<p>Qatar is a warm and unique place, and quickly growing as a tourist destination. We’re confident that our guests will love exploring Qatar as much as we have. We look forward to sharing all of our favorite things about this wonderful country as it acts as host to the biggest soccer tournament in the world.</p>

Top drivers in the fastest, most technologically-advanced racing cars on the planet, doing battle for the ultimate prize – the world championship.</p>
<p>The circuits are often as incredible as the racing, from traditional grand prix tracks boasting decades of history, to ultra-modern facilities setting new standards for design.</p>
<p>Here are the top 10 circuits that we think every F1 fan should see, plus details on the newest F1 venue: the Miami International Autodrome.</p>
<h3>Albert Park, Australian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> venue is a must-visit for F1 fans with serious wanderlust. The circuit itself is fast and flowing, the unique blend of street and permanent track features making it a real challenge for drivers. </p>
<p>Albert Park took advantage of the COVID-19 hiatus by making some major improvements to the circuit including widening pit lane as well as some of the corners and eliminating two turns. There are also plans to resurface the entire track before the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. </p>
<p>Even if you’ve attended the race before, the track renovations will offer a whole new viewing experience. And with the bustling Melbourne CBD on one side, and the eclectic seaside village of St Kilda on the other, you won’t be short of options for post-race socializing.</p>
<h3>Monaco Street Circuit, Monaco Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The jewel in Formula 1’s crown. Modern grand prix cars outgrew the<br />
famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaco street circuit</a> decades ago, but nobody cares.</p>
<p>Monaco is about the spectacle of watching great drivers thread the 900-horsepower needle through the Principality. It’s about the glamour and being seen in beautiful places with beautiful people.</p>
<p>There are no bad seats at the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. If you love Formula 1, this one has got to be top of the bucket list.</p>

<h3>Marina Bay, Singapore Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Singapore is spectacular enough all on its own. But throw in a Formula 1 race right in the city center, under lights no less, and you have something truly special.</p>
<p>As the original night race of the Formula 1 calendar, the  <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/singapore-grand-prix/">Singapore Grand Prix</a> has become a modern classic. Not only is the backdrop stunning, but Formula 1 cars just look faster under lights.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a> and its amazing night life literally surrounding the circuit caps off an incredible fan experience.</p>

<h3>Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Italian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The home of the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/italian-grand-prix/">Italian Grand Prix</a> is one of the most traditional circuits on the calendar, its history dating back to the 1920s.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ‘Tifosi’, the passionate band of Ferrari supporters, race day at Monza feels as much like a soccer match as it does a motor race.</p>
<p>Not only is the track one of the most historic venues on the Formula 1 calendar, it also happens to be located in one of Italy’s most alluring cities. Milan is known for being a leader in fashion and design and also boasts amazing eateries and fascinating cultural attractions.</p>

<h3>Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexican Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Like in Italy, it’s the crowd atmosphere that makes the latest incarnation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexican Grand Prix</a> so special.</p>
<p>The circuit features a unique stadium section built around the tight, twisty Turns 13/14/15 complex. Packed with fans cheering on local hero Sergio Perez, the stadium has quickly become a modern icon in grand prix racing.</p>
<h3>Silverstone, British Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The famous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> British circuit</a> is steeped in history, with the first race of the modern F1 era having taken place at Silverstone back in 1950.</p>
<p>Having been recently redeveloped, Silverstone now has modern, world-class facilities. The circuit itself, however, is still deliciously old school, retaining the fast, open nature that exposes its air base roots.</p>
<h3>Red Bull Ring, Austrian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Set to a stunning Styrian backdrop, the Red Bull Ring is another blend of classic flair and modern design.</p>
<p>Its latest stint as a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grand prix venue</a> has been underpinned by Austrian drinks giant Red Bull, which means little expense has been spared.</p>
<p>Between the rolling hillsides, the flowing track layout and the local love for Red Bull Racing, a trip to Spielberg is sure to impress.</p>
<h3>Circuit of the Americas, US Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Since joining the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/calendar-of-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F1 calendar</a> in 2012, the annual trip to COTA has become a favorite for drivers, teams and fans.</p>
<p>That’s partly due to the track, with its unique uphill run to the first turn and flowing, technical layout.</p>
<p>But the real drawcard is <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/united-states-grand-prix/">Austin</a> and its famous night life, which over a race weekend attracts people from all walks of F1 life.</p>

<h3>Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>Pouhon, Les Combes, La Source… Spa-Francorchamps, nestled in the Ardennes, is home to some of the world’s most famous corners.</p>
<p>But none are bigger, better or faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belgian circuit’s</a> calling card – Eau Rouge. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a single more spectacular place to watch Formula 1 cars.</p>
<p>Adding to the Spa spectacle are the thousands of Dutch fans that flock across the border, all dressed in orange, to passionately support Max Verstappen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-32416 size-full" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg" alt="Spa-Francorchamps, Belgian Grand Prix" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-1200x675-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Yas Marina, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/abu-dhabi-grand-prix/">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> venue encapsulates the modern opulence that the Middle East is famous for. But while it may be one of the newer kids on the block in terms of Formula 1 circuits, the marina itself – packed with the yachts of the rich and famous – gives it an old school grand prix feel.</p>
<p>Adding to the spectacle is the grand finish under lights, which marks the end of the season and the crowning of a new world champion.</p>
<p>To fully immerse in the experience, stay in one of the many luxury hotels on Yas Island. You may even find that your room overlooks the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/10-amazing-facts-abu-dhabis-yas-marina-circuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit</a>.</p>

Of the four grand slam tournaments in professional tennis (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open), Wimbledon always seems to attract the most attention. It seems to be a favorite major tennis tournament of the players too; American <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-best-tournament-in-world-sam-querrey-masters-a7825536.html">Sam Querrey notably referred to it as the best tournament</a>, comparing it to golf’s iconic Masters.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Major Tennis Tournaments to Attend</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Wimbledon – All England Club, London (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>It only makes sense to start the list of top tennis tournaments with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/05/30/what-is-the-most-prestigious-grand-slam-tennis-tournament/#1f09d9cf7696">most famous (and prestigious) tennis tournament</a> in the world. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/a-guide-to-the-wimbledon-championships/">Wimbledon</a> dates back to the year 1877 when the first tournament was played on the grass lawns of the All England Club just outside of London, England.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32789" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon-300x225.jpg" alt="major tennis tournaments of Wimbledon" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wimbledon is still played on grass courts, one of many long-standing traditions of this historic tournament. Appearances by the Royal Family (and other celebrities), fresh strawberries and cream, and the famous all-white dress code are other traditions that have become associated with the tournament.</p>
<p>One of the four major tennis tournaments (also known as grand slams), Wimbledon takes place over two weeks in late June/early July. It attracts a long list of the best tennis players in the world and has hosted some of the sport’s <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2514250-ranking-the-10-most-iconic-moments-in-wimbledon-history#slide1">most iconic matches</a> on the All England Club’s famous Centre Court.</p>

<h3><strong>US Open – National Tennis Center, New York (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>Usually the last Grand Slam of the season, the US Open is also the most famous professional US tennis tournament. The US Open was first played in 1881 as the US National Championship. What makes it one of the best tennis tournaments to attend? Well for starters, it offers a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/us-open-best-matches/what-makes-us-open-special/">different and unique atmosphere</a> than the other majors. It’s lively, fun, and exuberant, just like its host city, New York.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32461" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-300x200.jpg" alt="top tennis tournaments ar the US National Tennis Center" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu.jpg 848w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This top tennis tournament takes place at the US National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, NY, though many fans will <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/first-class-hotels/">stay in Manhattan</a> and take advantage of the city’s incredible dining, shopping, and entertainment when they’re not checking out the tennis. Just like Wimbledon, you’ll find no shortage of <a href="https://people.com/sports/celebrities-at-the-2021-us-open/">celebrity presence</a> at the US Open.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/">US Open</a> plays out each year in late <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/schedule/">August/early September</a> and we think it’s the perfect way to wrap up the summer. We’re not the only ones that think so. In 2021, the tournament attracted <a href="https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2021-09-12/us_open_final_by_the_numbers.html">a total of 631,134</a> tennis fans, who experienced the event in person. </p>

<h3><strong>Australian Open – Melbourne Park, Melbourne (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>The first of the four major tennis tournaments on the calendar, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/australian-open/">Australian Open</a> is a bucket list event for fans around the world. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open">the largest annual sporting event in the Southern hemisphere</a> and has taken place at Melbourne Park since 1988, though the tournament dates back to 1905.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16779" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open-300x200.jpg" alt="biggest tennis tournaments Australian open" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Australian Open is played on a hard-court surface and has been dominated by Novak Djokovic in recent years. He’s won the tournament nine times since 2008, giving him the record of most singles titles at the event.</p>
<p>As the first grand slam of the year, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/australian-open/schedule/">excitement is always high</a> for this famous Melbourne tennis event and as one of the highest attended, it definitely makes the list of best tennis tournaments.<strong> </strong></p>

<h3><strong>French Open – Roland Garros, Paris (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/french-open/">French Open</a> is different from the other major tennis tournaments in that it is the only one played on clay courts. Clay is known to be a <a href="https://www.ertheo.com/blog/en/type-tennis-courts/">difficult surface to play on</a>, due to the slower moving ball. Some players seem to excel on the clay, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, who won has an incredible thirteen French Open Championships.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16320" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open-300x200.jpg" alt="best tennis tournaments French open" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the best parts about the French Open is the amazing city of Paris. There’s a reason it is regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-08/the-50-most-beautiful-cities-in-the-world">most beautiful cities in the world</a>.

<h3><strong>The Summer Games – Roland Garros, Paris</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/">Summer Games</a> is unique in that it’s more than just a major tennis tournament. The best thing about the Summer Games tennis tournament is that fans can take in so many other incredible sporting events in one city surrounded by an incomparable atmosphere.</p>
<p>Tennis made its first Summer Games appearance at the inaugural event in 1896 but was later dropped in 1924. It returned in 1988 and has remained in the lineup ever since.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/">The 2024 Summer Games are in Paris, France,</a> and will take place July 26 to August 11, 2024. When tennis fans aren’t checking out the tennis action, they can watch the best athletes in the world compete in 31 other sports or explore the incredible country of France.</p>

<h3><strong>BNP Paribas Open – Indian Wells Tennis Garden, Indian Wells</strong></h3>
<p>There are many reasons we consider the BNP Paribas Open to be one of the top tennis tournaments. The first is, of course, the tennis itself. This major tennis tournament attracts the top players in the world, and is a favorite with fans as well. It regularly draws over 400,000 fans and in fact, <a href="https://bnpparibasopen.com/tournament/history/2011-present/">set an attendance record</a> at the 2019 tournament with 475,372 fans experiencing the tournament in person.</p>
<p>Another draw of the BNP Paribas Open is its location. The tournament refers to itself as <a href="https://bnpparibasopen.com/news/welcome-to-tennis-paradise/">“Tennis Paradise”</a> and it’s hard to argue that. The event takes place in Indian Wells, in the Palm Springs area of California. This stunning tourist destination offers luxury resorts, world-class golf, incredible shopping and dining, high-end spas, and plenty to appease the nature lovers. It also boasts wonderful weather, the perfect spot for a late winter getaway.</p>
<h3><strong>ATP Finals – Pala Alpitour Stadium, Turin</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nittoatpfinals.com/">ATP Finals</a> are another top tennis tournament. The ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) Finals date back to 1970, though it has gone through a few different names and versions since then. Since 2009, the tournament has been held at O2 Stadium in London, though this year it moves <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/48036923">to a new host city: Turin, Italy</a>.  </p>
<p>The ATP Finals follow a different format than the grand slams, which use a knock-out/bracket system. This event follows a group stage format. Each player is put into a group of four and plays each other player in his group. The top two from each group move on to a semi-final and then the championship final match.</p>
<h3><strong>WTA Finals – Panamerican Tennis Center, Guadalajara</strong></h3>
<p>The professional women have their own major tournament to cap off their season. The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour concludes with the WTA Finals, scheduled to take place in Guadalajara, Mexico from November 10-17, 2021. Shenzhen was awarded hosting duties until 2028, though the 2021 tournament was moved to Guadalajara due to COVID-19 concerns in China.</p>
<p>Similar to the ATP Finals, the tournament is played as a group-stage/round-robin format, followed by the semi-finals and finals. In 2019, the WTA Finals made history by offering the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/tennis/wta-finals-tennis-prize-money-china-spt-intl/index.html">biggest prize money in the sport’s history</a>, with a possible $4.75 million for the winner. To win the full amount, the winner would need to go undefeated in the tournament. In the end, singles winner Ashleigh Barty walked away with a cool <a href="https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/11/ashleigh-barty-elina-svitolina-wta-finals-shenzhen-record-prize-purse-breakthrough/85790/">$4.42 million</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Laver Cup – O2 Stadium, London</strong></h3>
<p>Named after popular Australian tennis pro Rod Laver, the Laver Cup is a relative newcomer to the tennis scene. The inaugural tournament took place in 2017 and it has been held annually since then, with the exception of 2020 due to COVID-19. The Laver Cup is a weekend tournament that pits players from Europe against players from the rest of the world. Each of the two teams (Team Europe and Team World) are comprised of six players: three that qualify based on their ranking and three that are chosen by team captains. John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg have served as Team Captains since the tournament began. </p>
<p>The location of the Laver Cup alternates between Europe and the rest of the world, with the 2022 tournament taking place in London. It’s a fun event and it’s always played on an indoor court, or one with a retractable roof, so there’s no worry about getting rained out.</p>

The atmosphere is always incredible, the soccer is top notch and the host cities are fascinating to explore. If you love soccer, here are the 12 best soccer tournaments you’ll want to experience in your lifetime:</p>
<h2>The World Cup</h2>
<p>It’s been over three years since the last World Cup played out in Russia. Along with our clients, we had a blast. Great goals, skills, shocking wins and even greater upsets, it provided everything that makes soccer so incredible, and emphasized the very things that contribute to the passionate fanbase. </p>
<p>We are counting down the days to the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/">2022 World Cup in Qatar</a>. Qatar offers a wide array for any soccer fan. Gorgeous beaches, enticing markets, world-class museums, stunning architecture and unique landscapes. Not to mention the weather! This will be the first World Cup tournament to take place in winter, so as to allow for the climate. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is that it will be the most compact tournament yet. All eight venues are clustered in and around Doha, making this a tremendous opportunity for soccer fans to base themselves in Doha and experience multiple matches a day or follow their team without checking out of their hotel. If the 2022 World Cup is anything like the 2018 event, then it is going to be nothing short of spectacular. Will France make it two in a row?</p>

<h2>The Summer Games</h2>
<p>One of the biggest soccer tournaments in the world, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">Summer Games</a> tournament is unique in that it features both a men’s and women’s competition. While the tournament dates way back to 1900 for the men, the women’s competition wasn’t introduced until 1996. With both winners decided in just over two weeks, it’s an action-packed tournament and lots of fun to watch. It’s also one of few sports at the Summer Games that allows guests to see events outside of the host city. In 2024, soccer matches will be played in seven Summer Games venues, including host city Paris.</p>
<p>Our favorite thing about the Summer Games Soccer Tournament is that it affords fans the opportunity to see more than just soccer. At the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">2024 Summer Games in Paris</a>, soccer fans will have the opportunity to supplement their experience with 31 other sports. Not only is it an incredible soccer experience, it’s one of the biggest sporting events in the world, hosted in one of the most fascinating countries on the planet.<br />

<h2>UEFA Champions League</h2>
<p>Another of the world’s best soccer tournaments, the UEFA Champions League sees the top clubs in Europe battle it out to earn the European Champion Clubs’ Cup. As the most watched annual sporting event in the world, it’s incredibly popular not just in Europe but around the globe. With over 60 years of history behind it, it continues to grow in popularity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/soccer-packages/champions-league-final/">2022 Champions League</a> Final will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia on May 28, 2022 and there’s never been a better reason to visit this beautiful historic city. St. Petersburg Stadium (2018 World Cup host city) will make an excellent host for the 2022 Champions League Final. Regardless of who wins it all next year, we know this will be one exciting tournament.</p>

<h2>UEFA European Championship</h2>
<p>The UEFA European Championship (also known as the Euro) is another quadrennial event and takes place on the even-numbered years between World Cup years. As one of the best soccer tournaments on the continent, it determines the champion of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). A total of 24 national teams qualify to compete for the elusive title of European Champion.</p>
<p>The next edition of the UEFA European Championship will take place in Germany in 2024. A total of ten German cities will host matches, with each host city offering something unique to spectators. It promises to be a spectacular event and one not to miss!</p>
<h2>Women’s World Cup</h2>
<p>Along with the Summer Games Tournament, this is one of the biggest and best soccer tournaments in the world for women. Like the men’s tournament, it is held every four years and always highly anticipated. In 2023, 32 of the best women’s national teams (up from 24 in 2019) will compete over the course of a month for bragging rights to the title of World Cup Champion.</p>
<p>The next Women’s World Cup will take place between July 20 and August 20, 2023 and it’s going to be a good one. Why? Well, it always delivers great soccer and this edition will be held in two of the most beautiful countries in the world: Australia and New Zealand. Nine amazing cities throughout the two countries will act as Women’s World Cup hosts, providing a spectacular backdrop to the popular tournament.<br />
<div id="attachment_24811" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24811" class="wp-image-24811 size-full" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/womens-world-cup.jpg" alt="2019 Women's Worlds in France" width="680"  /><p id="caption-attachment-24811" class="wp-caption-text">2019 Women&#8217;s Worlds in France</p></div></p>
<h2>Copa America Finals</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most passionate festival of soccer in the world, the Copa América is an international tournament primarily for countries in South America, with a reputation for games with stunning atmospheres. Many of the greatest players in soccer history have competed in the tournament, which is the longest-running international competition in the world, predating even the World Cup.</p>
<p>The Copa America has been hosted in many of South America’s most stunning destinations, always with a passionate fan base. Though details have yet to be finalized, it is expected that the next Copa América will be hosted by Ecuador in 2024. </p>
<h2>Copa Libertadores</h2>
<p>The Copa Libertadores is the most prestigious prize in South American domestic soccer, an annual tournament to decide the best club team on the continent. It has always been the biggest competition in South America, but some high-profile and dramatic recent tournaments have seen even more global attention placed on it, in particular the 2018 final which saw historic rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors, from Buenos Aires, battle it out for the trophy.</p>
<p>The final of the 2021 tournament will take place on November 27th. This year, the final will be held in Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay, and while Palmeiras are the current champions, this is one of the most open and exciting tournaments in the world.</p>
<h2>UEFA Europa League</h2>
<p>The sister tournament to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League has gone through many guises in its history but has developed into one of the most open and exciting annual soccer competitions in the world. While the Champions League is home to most of Europe’s established superpowers, the Europa League features a much wider range of new and interesting teams and destinations.</p>
<p>The final of the 2022 Europa League is due to take place in the historic Spanish city of Seville on May 18th, 2022, and the winner not only earns the Europa League trophy, but a place in the following year’s Champions League. Spanish and English teams have dominated the Europa League in recent years, but this is a thrilling soccer tournament that anyone can win.</p>
<h2>Africa Cup of Nations</h2>
<p>The Africa Cup of Nations is a biennial tournament to decide the best international team on the continent of Africa. A total of 24 teams battle it out to determine who is the finest team in Africa, with Egypt the most successful team in the competition’s history with seven wins, and Cameroon not far behind them with five. </p>
<p>The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations will be held in Cameroon from January 9th to February 6th, 2022 after being rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament will be held in six venues across 5 cities in Cameroon, with the final hosted at the newly constructed Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé.</p>
<h2>FA Cup</h2>
<p>The FA Cup is English soccer’s most prestigious knockout tournament and the oldest soccer competition in the world. The first tournament took place in 1871, and in the 150 years since it has remained the biggest and most coveted prize in English domestic soccer. This is the best tournament in the world for an underdog story, as the FA Cup is famous for its upsets, with the smallest teams in the country frequently defeating the biggest and richest.</p>
<p>Leicester City are the current holders, while Arsenal are the most successful team in the competition’s history with 14 victories, closely followed by Manchester United with 12. The final is always held at London’s Wembley Stadium, often regarded as the &#8220;home of soccer.&#8221; The 2022 final will take place on May 14th, 2022.</p>
<h2>Copa Del Rey</h2>
<p>Founded in 1903, the Copa del Rey – or King’s Cup – is the oldest tournament in Spanish soccer and is one of the best and most historic knock-out competitions in the world. For over a century, it has seen some of the biggest and most successful clubs in world soccer compete for the historic annual prize, which predates even Spain’s domestic league competition. </p>
<p>Barcelona are the current holders and most successful team in the competition’s history, having won the Copa del Rey an amazing 31 times, while their historic rivals Real Madrid have won it 19 times. The final of the 2022 Copa del Rey will be held in one of Spain’s many glamorous destinations, which combine a rich sense of soccer history alongside some of the greatest and most desirable cities in the world, like Madrid, Barcelona and Seville.</p>
<h2>Asian Cup</h2>
<p>You could say that the Asian Cup is the biggest regional soccer competition in the world, because it determines the best international team from Asia, the biggest continent on the planet and home to over 4.5 billion people. Held for the first time in 1956, the competition is held every four years in a different Asian country each time. Previous hosts have included Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia, who are part of the Asian Football Confederation. </p>
<p>The current holders are Qatar, who won the 2019 edition held in the United Arab Emirates, while the most successful country in the competition’s history is Japan, who have been successful four times.

Wondering which are the most watched sporting events in the world?</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>1. Tour de France &#8211; 3.5 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>The preeminent event in cycling takes place each summer in France. In addition to being one of the most prestigious competitions in the sport, it is also one of the most difficult with a course that winds through the country’s scenic mountain roads. The race consists of 21 stages totaling approximately 2,200 miles, raced over 23 days. Competitors race as part of an 8-person team, working together to achieve the fastest cumulative time.</p>
<p>Dating way back to 1903, the Tour de France has become one of the biggest events in the sporting world. A <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/racing/g20037343/14-questions-youve-always-had-about-the-tour-de-france/ ">recent article</a> estimates that 3.5 billion viewers worldwide tune in to watch the Tour de France every year.</p>
<p>Next Tour de France: July 1-24, 2022 in France</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>2. World Cup of Soccer &#8211; 3.3 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>

<p>In the same company as the Summer Games, the World Cup is right up there at the top in terms of popularity. This 32-team tournament (which will be <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/chicago-fire/fifa-approves-world-cup-expansion-48-teams-beginning-2026">expanded to 48 teams</a> in 2026) features national soccer teams from around the globe competing until ultimately one team is crowned champion. Held quadrennially, the World Cup is the pinnacle event in the sport and boasts huge attendance numbers every year. The 1950 Final game holds the record for attendance at a sporting event in an enclosed stadium with a whopping 199,854 spectators.</p>
<p>In terms of TV viewership, the World Cup numbers are regularly in the billions, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/world-cup-2018-half-the-worlds-population-tuned-in-to-this-years-soccer-tournament.html">3.262 billion</a> (that’s half the world’s population!) tuning in in 2018.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>3. Cricket World Cup &#8211; 2.6 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>North Americans may be surprised to find cricket on a list of most watched sporting events, but fans of the sport are well aware of how hugely popular cricket is in many parts of the world. The Cricket World Cup is the international championship for One Day International cricket. The contest features ten teams and lasts just over six weeks. Like the soccer World Cup, the tournament takes place every four years, with the next Cricket World Cup scheduled for 2023 in India.</p>
<p>The 2019 Cricket World Cup, hosted by England and Wales, set a new record for viewership. An incredible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_television_broadcasts">2.6 billion people</a> tuned in, making it the most watched cricket event of all time.</p>
<p>Next Cricket World Cup: February 9 – March 26, 2023 in India</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>4. Summer Games &#8211; 2 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the Summer Games are one of the most anticipated sporting events in the world. The Games not only offer a variety of different sports to watch, they also feature incredible personal triumphs, underdog stories, record-breaking feats of strength and endurance, and the opportunity to showcase national pride. With people around the world eager to cheer on their home country, it is no wonder billions of people want to spectate.</p>
<p>Every four years, the Summer Games are hosted in one of the world’s most attractive destinations, contributing to it being one of the highest attended sporting events. With a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/10-most-watched-sport-events-in-the-history-of-television_uk_5c7e84e8e4b06e0d4c22eebc?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAZjFUduoxqfvPXkmBeeFLePNQ_oR-WHHGl6Zq53yApx43hUz2uTGiE1APBdV9HOrwdX3rhnpvCa7jl4SKc0wKVqabGKgfkOwe36gaiRyX1QFWbGmHDpY4BnA_cibhu4MaBp5iiqHzT_X7_ZhewkZzi4R1cUbu3WYLaQcObQTJhr">global average reach of 2 billion viewers</a>, it’s also one of the most watched on TV.</p>

<p>Though it may not attract the same amount of attention as the Summer Games, the Winter Games are still a hugely popular event that draws interest from around the globe. With popular sports including figure skating, alpine skiing, ice hockey, and snowboarding, the Games reaches a broad audience. The Winter Games take place over a 17-day period every four years. The next edition of the Winter Games will take place in 2022 in Beijing, China, which will become the first destination to host both a Summer and Winter Games.</p>
<p>A quarter of the world’s population (1.92 billion people) <a href="https://sportcal.com/News/FeaturedNews/117906">tuned in</a> to watch a portion of the 2018 Winter Games, down slightly from the previous event in 2014, which drew 2.06 billion.</p>

<p>Women’s soccer is becoming more and more popular and as a result, the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France attracted a lot of interest. Following a similar format as the men’s tournament, national teams compete in a month-long tournament that begins with group-stage matches and ends with a knockout stage (playoff rounds).</p>
<p>With a hugely popular Team USA playing for first place, it makes sense that so many Americans wanted to watch the matches. But it wasn’t just Americans tuning in. The 2019 tournament smashed previous viewing records, with an incredible <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanaglass/2019/10/21/fifa-womens-world-cup-breaks-viewership-records/#1af948641884">1.12 billion watching worldwide</a>. It will be interesting to see if the numbers are even bigger at the next tournament in 2023.</p>
<p>Next Women’s World Cup: July 20 &#8211; August 20, 2023 in Australia and New Zealand</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>7. Boxing &#8211; 1 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Boxing is a fascinating sport. Casual observers may not hear much about the sport from day to day but the moment a major match is announced it draws huge attention from around the globe. Viewership is often measured by pay-per-view buys and these big-name bouts put up huge numbers.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, known as “The Greatest”, was one of boxing’s most popular fighters ever and was even named “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ali-chosen-centurys-greatest/">Sportsman of the Century</a>.” His fights received huge attention and were some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle">most watched sporting events of all time</a>, with numbers as high as one billion.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>8. UEFA Champions League &#8211; 380 Million Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Soccer is the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html">most popular sport in the world</a> and the UEFA Champions League Final is one of its biggest events. The top teams in Europe battle all season to be one of two teams in this prestigious championship match. This year’s Champions League Final will play out in Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, providing travelers with the perfect reason to visit this popular travel destination.</p>
<p>The Champions League Final is consistently one of the world’s most watched sporting events. For the 2018 Champion’s League Final in Kiev, <a href="https://www.footballwhispers.com/blog/super-bowl-champions-league-final-biggest-event">380 million people tuned in to watch</a> around the globe.

<p>Every year, American football fans count down the days until the big game: The Super Bowl.

While millions of people are tuned in for the game itself, the A-list halftime act and even the commercials attract viewers as well.</p>

Doha has been a wonderful destination to indulge in our passion for gastronomy and we love sharing our memorable dining experiences with our guests. Doha has no shortage of wonderful restaurants with more on the horizon. This flourishing city has a little bit of everything in terms of dining, including more than a few big names. We’ve enjoyed testing them out for you and have compiled a list of our favorites, which are detailed below.</p>
<h2>La Mar by Gaston Acurio</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lamar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" />223 Lusail Street<br />
<b>+974 4484 4919</b><br />doha.intercontinental.com/la-mar/</p>
<p>Acurio is a particularly celebrated chef who has helped to introduce Peruvian cuisine<br />
to the world. We’re big fans of La Mar’s location in Miami’s Mandarin Oriental and were excited to try the beachfront Doha eatery.Specialties include ceviches and tiraditos, which are delicious fresh fish dishes that incorporate various fresh fish with juices (usually citrus) and sauces. We also love their Lomo Saltado.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hakkasan</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hakkasan.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0170</b><br />hakkasan.com/doha </p>
<p>Another memorable meal was at Hakkasan, one of Doha’s hottest restaurants. With locations in London, NYC and Miami, it’s pretty famous. Hakkasan is known for having a great vibe and features Michelin star rated Cantonese and Asian fusion food within a nightclub feel. Located at the St. Regis, one of our 2022 World Cup properties, it’s wonderfully convenient for our guests of the property.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nobu</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nobu.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4494 8600</b><br />
www.fourseasons.com/doha/</p>
<p>As one of the most well-known restaurants in the world, we need not wax poetic about Nobu. What makes the Doha eatery a standout is its location at the end of a pier, providing guests with views over the water and back to the Corniche. It’s a pretty spectacular spot.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Astor Grill</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/astor.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0000</b><br />
www.astorgrilldoha.com</p>
<p>If you asked us where to find a great steak in Doha, we’d send you to Astor Grill. Inspired by New York steakhouses, Astor Grill presents a modern version complete with incredible cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and an extensive wine list. Another St. Regis gem.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STK</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stk.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />West Bay Lagoon<br />
<b>+974 4484 8588</b><br />
www.stk-doha.com</p>
<p>Our Ritz-Carlton guests have some incredible restaurants on-site too and STK is one of them. The popular restaurant has about ten outposts worldwide and boasts a club-like atmosphere. It’s a buzzing place with a fun atmosphere and great steak.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toro Toro</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/torotoro-doha.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5101</b><br />
www.torotorodoha.com</p>
<p>Located close to the St. Regis and the Ritz, Toro Toro offers modern Mexican influenced cuisine by Richard Sandoval (foodies may know his name from La Lagune, Brisas at Mayakoba or another of his 30+ restaurants worldwide).</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nozomi</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nozomi.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5089</b><br />
www.nozomi-doha.com</p>
<p>The multiple award winning Nozomi is consistently well rated and a local favorite. It’s<br />
a happening place that offers contemporary Japanese cuisine and spectacular water<br />
views.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spice Market</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spice-market.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4453 5135</b><br />
www.spicemarketdoha.com</p>
<p>The concept is Southeast Asian Street Food in an upscale atmosphere and it definitely<br />
works. Spice Market was named Time Out Doha’s Restaurant of the Year in 2018 and<br />
Best Asian Restaurant in 2019. The menu is extensive and the only downside is not being<br />
able to sample it all.</p>

<p>Located inside the stunning Museum of Islamic Art (MIA), IDAM is Alain Ducasse’s first<br />
restaurant in the Middle East. The menu is mostly French Mediterranean with Arabic<br />
influences. The décor, courtesy of Philippe Starck, provides a memorable backdrop<br />
to the wonderful food. The service and the views are also excellent. The museum is<br />
absolutely worth visiting too!</p>

This renowned event is the most famous tennis tournament in the world and for good reason. There’s no arguing the tennis is first-class, but the host city is pretty special too. London is the perfect international destination for us anglophones. It’s exotic but not intimidating and it’s brimming with incredible attractions, fantastic eateries, world-famous shopping, and charming neighborhoods to discover. We’ve spent plenty of time in <a href="https://go.skyetrips.com/guide/london-travel-guide">London</a> and wanted to share our favorite ways to experience this fascinating city.</p>
<p>Seeing all the big attractions is one way to tour the city, but we’ve discovered so many other ways to enjoy London. From simple ways to spend a few hours to quintessential British experiences, these are some of our favorite things to do when we’re in London.</p>
<h2>See a West End Show</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show.jpeg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Right up there with Broadway in terms of prestige, the West End theatres feature some of the hottest shows in the world. There are few better ways to spend a London evening than a great dinner and a West End Show. Our personal concierges can help with suggestions, dinner reservations, and show tickets.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Afternoon Tea</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea.jpeg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Is there anything more quintessentially British than afternoon tea? We think not. Whether you’re a tea drinker or not, it really is quite an experience. Our favorite spot for this wonderful tradition is at the Palm Court in the iconic Ritz London. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sunday Roast at a Local Pub</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast.jpg 730w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Sunday roast is one of England&#8217;s most beloved traditions. You’ll find many different versions ranging from very casual at the neighborhood pub to trendy upscale gastropub offerings. Whichever route you choose, it’s likely to be one of your most memorable meals. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Explore a New Neighborhood</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods-300x199.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48283" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you’re feeling adventurous, hop on the tube (an experience in itself) and head to one of London’s many interesting neighborhoods to do some exploring. Each neighborhood seems to have its own personality and you’re likely to discover new restaurants, shops, and gardens. Outside of London&#8217;s core which includes Mayfair, Westminster, the West End and Knightsbridge, some other sure bets include Chelsea, Richmond, Kensington and Bloomsbury. There are endless choices for exploring London’s unique neighborhoods. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Check out the Culture</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48284" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums.jpeg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There’s an endless list of museums and art galleries in London, many of which don’t charge an admission fee. The well-known National Gallery, Tate Britain, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery are amongst the most popular and frequently visited. In South Kensington, spend a drizzly day exploring the Natural History Museum, the Victoria &#038; Albert Museum and the Science Museum; they form an excellent collection within walking distance of each other. The Wallace Collection, Saatchi Gallery and Dulwich Picture Gallery are smaller, more hidden away gems.</p>

Monaco has long been a favorite destination of travelers in search of luxury and glamour. Its luxury hotels are among the finest in the world and we’ve hand-picked some of the best for our Monaco Grand Prix guests. We’ve been traveling to Monaco for many years and would love to help you find the perfect accommodations fit during the biggest event of the year. To help you get started, we’ve detailed some of our favorite Monaco properties below.</p>
<p>In this principality that is known for the finer things, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/">accommodations</a> are no exception. The hotels here are some of the most luxurious anywhere. Those who travel with us to the Monaco Grand Prix will have access to some of the best properties in the region. Our hotels are carefully chosen not only for their quality, but also for their prime location and impressive amenities. </p>
<p>One of the things that is great about our curated selection of properties is that our guests can choose their preferred hotel experience. From the formal and elegant Hotel Hermitage to the younger and more relaxed Le Meridien Beach Plaza, we feel it’s important to pick the location and type of accommodations that best fits your mood and style. Part of the decision is whether to stay at Casino Square, which during the Grand Prix is really quite busy, or to choose a little more space closer to Larvotto Beach. </p>
<p>For those that like to start the day with a walk or run, or want to stay a little outside the bottleneck that is Casino Square, our recommendation would be either the Le Meridien Beach Plaza or the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel. </p>
<h2>LE MERIDIEN BEACH PLAZA</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22838" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Boasting an exclusive private beach, this modern resort hotel is a very nice hotel and a great value during the Grand Prix. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#meridien">Le Meridien</a> has great views to the Mediterranean, is contemporary in design, relaxed and chic in its vibe, and it’s outside of the crush of Casino Square, perfect for an early morning run or a walk on the beach followed by a frothy cappuccino. The food options are good, but not great, though you have lots of great options within a few minutes walk of the hotel. The gym, indoor and outdoor pools, and beach are second to none in Monaco. The rooms are well designed and spacious by European standards. Beds are comfortable and the Malin &#038; Goetz bathroom amenities are a nice touch. </p>
<h2>MONTE CARLO BAY HOTEL </h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg" alt="monte carlo bay" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18134" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This luxury hotel was built on reclaimed land and was a welcome addition to the hotel scene in Monaco. Essentially next door to the Le Meridien, <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#monte">this property</a> also allows you a bit of breathing room during the Grand Prix. This lavishly designed hotel has a Vegas meets French Riviera feel with expensive gardens, a grand entrance, and extensive views of the sea. The swimming pool complex is happening and includes a sand bottomed pool, a giant glass panelled conservatory and a well equipped fitness facility with a plush spa and yoga classes. The rooms are spacious with bathrooms that boast separate shower and bath, with amenities from the hotel’s Cinq Mondes Spa. With an in-house Michelin starred restaurant, Blue Bay, you know they are committed to providing guests with culinary delights. A lagoon-facing terrace at L’Hippocampe and the comfortable Blue Gin Bar both make for a relaxing on-property snack or cocktail. </p>
<h2>HOTEL HERMITAGE</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5-10-300x200.jpg" alt="hotel hermitage" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18122" />One of the grande dames of the hotel scene in Monaco is the elegant <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#hermitage">Hotel Hermitage</a>. This Belle Epoque palace is tucked away behind the Hotel de Paris and is a favorite of those pretending to fly under the radar. This opulent 19th century palace has all the gold leaf and marble topped commodes you would expect, given the line of Lamborghinis and Bentleys “discreetly” parked out front. Service is courteous and competent, with female staff adorned with silk scarves and waistcoated bellboys. Guests can charge any Monte Carlo SBM facilities to their room including one of the most impressive thermal spas in Europe. Rooms feature Louis XV style furniture and wallpaper, bathrooms contain plenty of marble, and products are by the legendary Parisian perfume maker Francis Kurkdjian. The Michelin starred Vistamar may be “the” place for seafood in Monaco, though any of the hotel’s eateries come with plenty of prestige wines and vintage champagne, making sure you don’t forget you are staying in a palace. </p>
<h2>HOTEL METROPOLE</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg" alt="hotel metropole" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18136" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#metropole">The Metropole</a> manages to seamlessly bridge a number of themes and styles, making it the choice for rockstars and royalty alike. Behind the monumental Belle Epoque facade, this hotel perfectly delivers both classic elegance and a relaxed modern vibe. The bar and lounge are a 21st century take on a 19th century drawing room. There are books and tapestries bathed in light and space. Just up from the casino and off the Boulingrins Gardens, it could not be more central. And then there is the name dropping; from the Michelin-starred cuisine at Christophe Cussac’s Yoshi to Karl Lagerfeld’s creation, Odyssey, a pool and restaurant oasis available only to hotel and spa guests, this hotel has cachet to spare. The rooms combine period furniture, flowing fabrics, art and artifacts with contemporary sensitivity and comfort. You will feel like a royal noble, except that these rooms are too well thought out for that. They may be pricey, but live a weekend in them and you will swear it is completely worth it. </p>
<p><b>And, for a hidden gem and completely other experience&#8230; </b></p>
<h2>CAP ESTEL</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg" alt="cap estel monaco" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47905" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Set on a tiny peninsula just outside the borders of Monaco, this small, luxurious gated mansion is the perfect A-list hideaway. Only minutes from the glitz and excitement of the Grand Prix, it offers its guests the very best of discreet service and luxe surroundings. With only 28 rooms and suites across three buildings, each with expansive views of the sea, this lush property combines elegant design and decor with the latest in technology. Add the Michelin starred creations of chef Patrick Raingeard and you truly have the ultimate in discreet luxury and exceptional service. </p>

After many years of experience, we’ve nailed down our best pieces of advice for anyone attending.</p>
<h2>What to Wear</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat-300x157.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="157" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47790" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the highlights of Derby is dressing up in a fashionable dress, fancy heels and a great hat. Our best tip: bring a pair of flip-flops or ballet flats to change into later in the day. After a day of walking between the paddock, spectator seating and the refreshment areas, your feet will thank you.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Check out the Paddock Area</h2>
<p>This large, open space is a place to see and be seen, and visitors can get surprisingly close to the horses as they’re paraded through the paddock pre-race. It’s also a great location to photograph the spectacular hats and colorful outfits of the spectators.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-1024x292.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="292" class="alignright size-large wp-image-47788" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-1024x292.jpg 1024w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-300x86.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-768x219.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Celebrities</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-celebrities-272x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="280" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47797" />For those hoping for a celebrity sighting, check out the Derby Red Carpet at Churchill Downs’ Gate 10, where many celebrities will walk on their way up to their VIP seats. If you want to get even closer to the celebs, you may want to consider attending the Barnstable Brown Gala, the most exclusive event of the weekend. <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>VIP Seating Options</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience-300x191.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="191" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47800" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience-300x191.jpeg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience.jpeg 398w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Speaking of VIP seating, those seats aren’t just for celebrities. If you want the ultimate Derby experience, we can arrange for a spot for you in one of the premium viewing areas including Millionaires Row, the Turf Club, the Finish Line Suites Balcony, and the Stakes Room. If you simply want to make sure you have a covered seat to protect you from the elements, our team can advise on which sections will best suit your needs.</p>
<h2>Food and Drink</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep-300x155.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47789" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep.jpg 657w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />No visit to Louisville would be complete without two things: sipping a mint julep and having a hot brown: an open-faced sandwich with sliced turkey, bacon and mornay sauce. As far as we’re concerned, there’s no better place to try your first mint julep than at Churchill Downs during the Kentucky Derby. As for the Hot Brown, we suggest trying the original at the historic Brown Hotel, one of our luxury properties.</p>
<h2>Experience Thurby</h2>
<p>A popular event with locals, Thursday at Churchill Downs (aptly named Thurby) offers a different experience than Friday or Saturday. There are races of course but there are also musical performances and other entertainment acts. Thurby also provides guests with a great opportunity to explore Churchill Downs.</p>

It’s widely considered to be the most prestigious golf tournament and each year, thousands flock to Augusta National Golf Club to witness this historic event. The Masters is steeped in history and tradition, including its own set of rules and customs. We’ve complied some of our best Masters etiquette tips to enable you to fully enjoy the tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>No phones or cameras</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46703 size-medium" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-300x169.jpg" alt="masters phone not allowed" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120718100621-golf-no-phones-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the most talked about rules at the Masters is the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-masters-cellphones-banned-augusta-national-20190410-story.html">ban on phones</a> and cameras. It’s one of the few places in today’s world where everyone is unplugged.</p>
<p>Even without your phone or camera, there are still a few ways to get pictures at the Masters. Cameras are permitted for the practice rounds so you are able to snap as many pics as you like those days. For the tournament rounds, there is a picture line near the first hole where the club will take a picture of you with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background.</p>
<p>If you do need to make a phone call while you’re at the tournament, there are plenty of public phones on the course. Enjoy the rare opportunity to take a break from being available 24/7.</p>
<h2><strong>Leaving chairs on the course </strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46704 size-medium" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-300x158.jpg" alt="masters golf chairs" width="300" height="158" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/masters-chairs.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For your visit to the Masters, you are permitted to bring your own chair provided it is collapsible and does not have armrests. If you don’t have one that fits the requirements, you can purchase an official Masters golf chair at the tournament, which also happens to make a great souvenir.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Masters week is that once you pick your preferred spot to place your chair, you can leave it there for the day and not worry about someone taking the chair or your spot. It’s pretty much unheard of at the Masters and one of the tournament’s many joys.</p>
<h2><strong>Referring to guests as patrons</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve watched the Masters on TV, you’ll notice that fans on the course are almost always referred to as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/sports/golf/masters-no-fans-patrons.html">patrons</a>.” This tradition is attributed to Clifford Roberts, co-founder of Augusta National Golf Club, who strived to provide a more distinguished experience for spectators. The term dates back to the beginning of the tournament in 1934.</p>
<h2><strong>Prohibited items</strong></h2>
<p>There are a number of items prohibited at The Masters tournament. In addition to phones and cameras, no electronic devices are allowed on the course. Other prohibited items include flags, banners, signs, food and drink, and bags larger than 10” x 10” x 12”. A complete list of Masters prohibited items can be found on our <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/luxury-travel-guides/masters-tips/">Masters Tournament Tips and FAQS.</a></p>
<h2><strong>What to wear</strong></h2>
<p>At the Masters, most patrons dress in “golf casual” attire including collared shirts and long pants or golf shorts. We recommend to dress like you are playing. Keep in mind there are a couple of items that are not permitted to wear at the Masters: denim (jeans) and golf shoes with metal spikes. If you are wearing a hat, be sure not to wear it backwards.</p>
<h2><strong>Autographs</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-46705" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-300x200.jpg" alt="par3 autograph masters augusta" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1924662_web1_MAS0405420SDCPar3Watson-scaled.jpg 1597w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you’re hoping to snag an autograph or two from the pros, your best bet is the Par 3 tournament on the Wednesday of Masters week. The atmosphere is a little more relaxed and the players are more likely to engage with fans. Other than that, the only other place autographs are permitted is at the practice range. Autographs are prohibited anywhere on the course during the Masters tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>Children and babies</strong></h2>
<p>Children and babies are permitted at the Masters, though they are expected to follow the rules and exhibit appropriate behavior. Guardians are considered responsible for their child’s behavior and may be asked to leave if it becomes disruptive. Strollers are not permitted at Augusta National.</p>
<h2><strong>Weather warning/inclement weather </strong></h2>
<p>In the unlikely event of inclement weather, pay attention to the scoreboards and message boards for the tournament’s weather warning sign. If this appears, for everyone’s safety you are expected to seek shelter nearby and avoid risky areas including bodies of water, isolated trees, open areas, grandstands and wire fences.</p>
<h2><strong>Two gate entries per day</strong></h2>
<p>Patrons are not permitted more than two gate entries per day, or in other words, you can leave the club only once after you have been admitted. But really, once you’ve arrived on the hallowed grounds of Augusta National, why would you want to leave?</p>
<h2><strong>No animals other than service animals</strong></h2>
<p>This one is fairly common sense but don’t plan on bringing your pet to witness the golf action. Service animals are permitted.</p>
<h2><strong>Quiet</strong></h2>
<p>Be quiet during play. While the norm at some sporting events involves shouting and making noise, the Masters is not one of them.</p>
<h2><strong>Walk, don’t run</strong></h2>
<p>Running is not permitted anywhere on the course. As patrons move from hole to hole, you’ll notice plenty of people speed walking, but no running.</p>
<h2><strong>Stay behind the ropes</strong></h2>
<p>At the Masters, there are ropes blocking areas where patrons are not permitted. This rule applies whether there are players in the area or not. Never go under the ropes and be sure to use the marked crosswalks to get around.</p>
<h2><strong>No napping</strong></h2>
<p>As tempting as the plush green grass of Augusta National is, refrain from laying down for a rest, and from taking off your shoes at any point.</p>
<h2><strong>Leave the course as you found it</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-26538" src="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg" alt="masters tips" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.skyetrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/augusta-national-golf-club-the-masters.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Augusta National is one of the most pristine courses you’ll ever see and it is expected that patrons will help keep it that way. Be respectful, don’t litter, and don’t help yourself to a souvenir; in 2012, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/augusta-national-sand-stealer-arrest-cost-2019-4">a patron was arrested</a> for trying to take sand from the course as a memento.</p>
<h2><strong>Be on your best behavior</strong></h2>
<p>Like most professional golf tournaments, proper decorum is rule of the day. So bring your best manners with you, make sure you follow the expectations and you’re sure to have the experience of a lifetime.</p>
