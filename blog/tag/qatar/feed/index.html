Doha has been a wonderful destination to indulge in our passion for gastronomy and we love sharing our memorable dining experiences with our guests. Doha has no shortage of wonderful restaurants with more on the horizon. This flourishing city has a little bit of everything in terms of dining, including more than a few big names. We’ve enjoyed testing them out for you and have compiled a list of our favorites, which are detailed below.</p>
<h2>La Mar by Gaston Acurio</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lamar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" />223 Lusail Street<br />
<b>+974 4484 4919</b><br />doha.intercontinental.com/la-mar/</p>
<p>Acurio is a particularly celebrated chef who has helped to introduce Peruvian cuisine<br />
to the world. We’re big fans of La Mar’s location in Miami’s Mandarin Oriental and were excited to try the beachfront Doha eatery.Specialties include ceviches and tiraditos, which are delicious fresh fish dishes that incorporate various fresh fish with juices (usually citrus) and sauces. We also love their Lomo Saltado.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hakkasan</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hakkasan.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0170</b><br />hakkasan.com/doha </p>
<p>Another memorable meal was at Hakkasan, one of Doha’s hottest restaurants. With locations in London, NYC and Miami, it’s pretty famous. Hakkasan is known for having a great vibe and features Michelin star rated Cantonese and Asian fusion food within a nightclub feel. Located at the St. Regis, one of our 2022 World Cup properties, it’s wonderfully convenient for our guests of the property.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nobu</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nobu.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4494 8600</b><br />
www.fourseasons.com/doha/</p>
<p>As one of the most well-known restaurants in the world, we need not wax poetic about Nobu. What makes the Doha eatery a standout is its location at the end of a pier, providing guests with views over the water and back to the Corniche. It’s a pretty spectacular spot.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Astor Grill</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/astor.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0000</b><br />
www.astorgrilldoha.com</p>
<p>If you asked us where to find a great steak in Doha, we’d send you to Astor Grill. Inspired by New York steakhouses, Astor Grill presents a modern version complete with incredible cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and an extensive wine list. Another St. Regis gem.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STK</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stk.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />West Bay Lagoon<br />
<b>+974 4484 8588</b><br />
www.stk-doha.com</p>
<p>Our Ritz-Carlton guests have some incredible restaurants on-site too and STK is one of them. The popular restaurant has about ten outposts worldwide and boasts a club-like atmosphere. It’s a buzzing place with a fun atmosphere and great steak.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toro Toro</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/torotoro-doha.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5101</b><br />
www.torotorodoha.com</p>
<p>Located close to the St. Regis and the Ritz, Toro Toro offers modern Mexican influenced cuisine by Richard Sandoval (foodies may know his name from La Lagune, Brisas at Mayakoba or another of his 30+ restaurants worldwide).</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nozomi</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nozomi.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5089</b><br />
www.nozomi-doha.com</p>
<p>The multiple award winning Nozomi is consistently well rated and a local favorite. It’s<br />
a happening place that offers contemporary Japanese cuisine and spectacular water<br />
views.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spice Market</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spice-market.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4453 5135</b><br />
www.spicemarketdoha.com</p>
<p>The concept is Southeast Asian Street Food in an upscale atmosphere and it definitely<br />
works. Spice Market was named Time Out Doha’s Restaurant of the Year in 2018 and<br />
Best Asian Restaurant in 2019. The menu is extensive and the only downside is not being<br />
able to sample it all.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IDAM</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alain-ducasse.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4422 4488</b><br />
www.mia.org.qa/en/visiting/idam</p>
<p>Located inside the stunning Museum of Islamic Art (MIA), IDAM is Alain Ducasse’s first<br />
restaurant in the Middle East. The menu is mostly French Mediterranean with Arabic<br />
influences. The décor, courtesy of Philippe Starck, provides a memorable backdrop<br />
to the wonderful food. The service and the views are also excellent. The museum is<br />
absolutely worth visiting too!</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doha clearly has some amazing restaurants and there&#8217;s a lot more to love about this incredible city.
