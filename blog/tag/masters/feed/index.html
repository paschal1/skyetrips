Over the last decade, we’ve seen a number of inventive and sophisticated eateries popping up around the city, joining some beloved Augusta classics. The result is a variety of memorable dining experiences for visitors to take advantage of.</p>
<p>We understand how much great meals can add to a travel experience. Discovering remarkable food is one of our favorite things about traveling and we’ve spent plenty of time scouting out some great options for our Masters guests.</p>
<p>After many visits to Augusta and years of delicious research, we’ve listed some of our top Augusta restaurant recommendations below. The diverse list includes options to please virtually any palate. If you’re traveling to the Masters with us, your pre-travel personal concierge would be happy to help out with some custom recommendations based on your tastes.</p>
<h3>Downtown</h3>
<h2>Frog Hollow Tavern</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49883" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.6906</strong><br />
www.froghollowtavern.com<br />
Simply put, it’s one of the best in the city. They just seem to do everything right. The<br />
focus on service is as important as the quality of the food, creating an ideal farm-to-table dining experience. The menu changes seasonally so it’s a new experience every year. There’s an impressive wine list too if you’re so inclined. This is the place to go in Augusta, you’ll need to make reservations well in advance.</p>
<h2>Farmhaus Burger</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49886" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8771</strong><br />
www.farmhausburger.com<br />
This isn’t your average burger. A sister restaurant to Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus serves up gourmet burgers made from locally-sourced ingredients. Agonize over which delicious option to choose from or create your own. Whatever you decide on, we recommend pairing it with the housemade sweet potato tots. Fun, casual, and they even have gluten free options. There is a second location in Flowing Wells.</p>
<h2>Craft &#038; Vine</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49888" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8442</strong><br />
craftandvine.com<br />
The third member of the Frog Hollow Tavern family is Craft &#038; Vine. This downtown cocktail bar serves up flavorful small plates and wood-fired pizzas. Open late, it’s a great place for a nightcap; sip on a handcrafted cocktail or a great glass of wine while<br />
reminiscing about a great day of golf.</p>
<h2>The Boll Weevil Café</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49889" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.722.7772</strong><br />
www.thebollweevil.com<br />
Ask anyone in Augusta where to go for dessert and you’ll likely be directed to the Boll Weevil. Yes, they offer lunch and dinner as well but the long list of sweet treats are the highlight. We’d recommend our favorite dessert but it’s impossible to pick just one. Its proximity to the Riverwalk makes it a nice spot for a refreshment if you’re in the area.</p>
<h3>Surrey Center</h3>
<h2>Calvert’s</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49890" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.4514</strong><br />
calvertsrestaurant.net<br />
Calvert’s is the reigning fine dining choice in Augusta. A long time favorite of both our<br />
clients and our staff, it’s the best place in town for steak and seafood. The service is<br />
impeccable, the food is superb, and the wine list is the best in the city. Calvert’s is an<br />
Augusta landmark; you’ll need to make reservations well ahead for this one, particularly<br />
for Masters week.</p>
<h2>Finch &#038; Fifth</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49891" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.5300</strong><br />
www.finchandfifth.com<br />
Augusta has been blessed with a number of creative new restaurants in the last decade<br />
and Finch &#038; Fifth is one of them. The dishes are mostly modern takes on Southern<br />
classics and there’s also a charcuterie and cheese menu. Good food and drink, friendly,<br />
unpretentious.</p>
<h2>Abel Brown Southern Kitchen &#038; Oyster Bar</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49892" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.6491</strong><br />
www.abelbrownaugusta.com<br />
Chef Todd Schafer has been a staple on the Augusta restaurant scene for many years<br />
and Abel Brown is his latest venture. The oysters are excellent but so is everything else<br />
we’ve tried. We think it’s well-deserving of the phenomenal reviews it’s received over<br />
the years.</p>
<h2>Oliviana</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49893" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-723-1242</strong><br />
www.olivianaitaliano.com<br />
This great eatery boasts some of our favorite pizza in Augusta. If you’re not in the mood<br />
for pizza, Oliviana’s Italian menu is extensive and you’re sure to find something that will<br />
make your mouth water. Small and intimate, Oliviana’s atmosphere is as enjoyable as<br />
the food. They’re open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.</p>
<h3>Village West</h3>
<h2>Edgar’s Grille</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49894" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-854-4700</strong><br />
www.edgarsgrille.com<br />
Edgar’s serves up New American cuisine with a southern flair and their farm-to-table<br />
dishes are wonderful. Whatever dish piques your interest, be sure to complement it<br />
with a side of truffle fries. Edgar’s Grille is one of our favorites and it’s more than just<br />
a restaurant. It’s also a training center for culinary students at Helms College. The<br />
restaurant gives back a portion of their profits toward local education programs, in case<br />
you needed another great reason to eat here.</p>
<h2>Cork &#038; Flame</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49887" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-922-9463</strong><br />
www.corkandflame.com<br />
Cork &#038; Flame combines fine dining, small bites, and one of the largest wine<br />
selections in the area with close to 3,000 labels. The dining room offers self-described<br />
“Progressive American Cuisine,” which can be enjoyed a la carte, as part of a fourcourse tasting menu, or as the eight-course chef’s table experience. The Cork &#038; Flame<br />
also has a fairly extensive vegetarian menu, making it a great option for plant-based<br />
eaters.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Masters week is a busy week for restaurants in Augusta and we recommend making reservations well in advance (think months, not weeks) to avoid missing out. It’s important to note that many restaurants have strict reservation policies for this particular week. Augusta has some amazing restaurants and we hope you’ll enjoy trying them out as much as we have. </p>
