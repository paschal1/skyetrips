This picturesque country has planned an ideal setup for the tournament. With all the stadiums clustered within a small radius, it allows guests to maximize their time in Qatar, whether it be taking in matches or exploring the beauty of this world-class destination.</p>
<h3>Qatar Travel Tips</h3>
<p>Wondering what to expect during your visit to Qatar for the World Cup? Our staff has made multiple visits to Qatar in preparation for the event, each time discovering more about the country. Below we’ve detailed what we’ve learned about Qatar and its culture to help you plan your trip and enjoy your visit.</p>
<h3>All About Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49527" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a fascinating destination and the 2022 World Cup is the perfect reason to travel to this dynamic, thriving country. Qatar, and specifically its capital Doha, offers a wonderful blend of stunning, ultramodern high rises and 100-year-old cultural heritage sites, an enchanting mix of old and new. Plus, there are so many memorable experiences for visitors within a few hours’ drive of the capital. You can read about some of our top recommendations in our blog <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/blog/things-to-see-and-do-in-doha-during-the-2022-world-cup/">“Things to See and Do in Doha During the 2022 World Cup.”</a></p>
<h3>During your Visit</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49529" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We think our guests will immediately feel comfortable in Qatar. The people are friendly and welcoming. Crime is incredibly rare, and in fact, Doha was recently named <a href="https://www.luxurytravelmagazine.com/news-articles/doha-ranks-second-safest-city-in-the-world">one of the safest cities in the world</a>. English is widely spoken, largely due Doha’s sizable expat population. Much of the signage around the city is in English, which makes getting around and communicating a breeze compared to other foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Dining in Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-31380" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg" alt="La Mar Doha" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar.jpg 715w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of our favorite things about Qatar is the food. Doha has some wonderful world-class eateries including big names like Hakkasan, Nobu and Morimoto. The list of notable restaurants is long and we’ve enjoyed trying out as many as we can. So much so that we wrote a whole blog about it <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/blog/best-restaurants-in-doha-for-the-2022-world-cup/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>Those wondering about Qatar’s alcohol policy and whether they’ll be able to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner will be happy to know the answer is yes. In fact, there are many famous bars and restaurants — primarily in hotels — that serve the same handcrafted cocktails you’d find in other global travel hot spots.</p>
<h3>Tipping</h3>
<p>While tipping is not a traditional practice in Qatar, it has become more common due to the large expat population. Often a service charge will be included on your bill when dining out. If not, a tip at your discretion is usually appreciated.</p>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28694" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We are very particular about hotels and fortunately Qatar has some wonderful options from intimate boutique-style properties to five-star beach resorts. Our World Cup guests have access to some of the best hotels in the country including the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">Ritz-Carlton Doha</a> and the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">St. Regis Doha</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting Around Qatar for the World Cup</h3>
<p>Doha is in the process of completing a state-of-the-art rapid transit system (Doha Metro) that is being lauded as one of the most advanced rail transportation systems in the world. Complete with first-class sections (called Gold Club), Doha Metro’s modern trains can transport passengers up to 100km/h, bypassing bad traffic. With a system designed specifically for the tournament, the Doha Metro will be the most efficient way to traverse the city and access the stadiums during the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<h3>Weather in Qatar</h3>
<p>World Cup organizers have meticulously planned the event to ensure that players and spectators can enjoy comfortable weather during the tournament. The 2022 World Cup was moved from its traditional summer dates to Qatar’s winter in order to take advantage of the more enjoyable temperatures. The 2022 World Cup will take place from November 21 to December 18, when temperatures average 68-86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30°C). In addition, all the World Cup host stadiums have been constructed with cooling systems.</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49487" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a conservative country and you’ll find many of the locals dressed in traditional clothing. While visitors are not expected to dress in the same manner, it is recommended to be sensitive to their culture by dressing modestly. This includes keeping shoulders, upper arms and knees covered. Swimwear is acceptable on the beach or by the pool.</p>
<p>Qatar is a warm and unique place, and quickly growing as a tourist destination. We’re confident that our guests will love exploring Qatar as much as we have. We look forward to sharing all of our favorite things about this wonderful country as it acts as host to the biggest soccer tournament in the world.</p>

The atmosphere is always incredible, the soccer is top notch and the host cities are fascinating to explore. If you love soccer, here are the 12 best soccer tournaments you’ll want to experience in your lifetime:</p>
<h2>The World Cup</h2>
<p>It’s been over three years since the last World Cup played out in Russia. Along with our clients, we had a blast. Great goals, skills, shocking wins and even greater upsets, it provided everything that makes soccer so incredible, and emphasized the very things that contribute to the passionate fanbase. </p>
<p>We are counting down the days to the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/">2022 World Cup in Qatar</a>. Qatar offers a wide array for any soccer fan. Gorgeous beaches, enticing markets, world-class museums, stunning architecture and unique landscapes. Not to mention the weather! This will be the first World Cup tournament to take place in winter, so as to allow for the climate. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is that it will be the most compact tournament yet. All eight venues are clustered in and around Doha, making this a tremendous opportunity for soccer fans to base themselves in Doha and experience multiple matches a day or follow their team without checking out of their hotel. If the 2022 World Cup is anything like the 2018 event, then it is going to be nothing short of spectacular. Will France make it two in a row?</p>

<h2>The Summer Games</h2>
<p>One of the biggest soccer tournaments in the world, the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">Summer Games</a> tournament is unique in that it features both a men’s and women’s competition. While the tournament dates way back to 1900 for the men, the women’s competition wasn’t introduced until 1996. With both winners decided in just over two weeks, it’s an action-packed tournament and lots of fun to watch. It’s also one of few sports at the Summer Games that allows guests to see events outside of the host city. In 2024, soccer matches will be played in seven Summer Games venues, including host city Paris.</p>
<p>Our favorite thing about the Summer Games Soccer Tournament is that it affords fans the opportunity to see more than just soccer. At the <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">2024 Summer Games in Paris</a>, soccer fans will have the opportunity to supplement their experience with 31 other sports. Not only is it an incredible soccer experience, it’s one of the biggest sporting events in the world, hosted in one of the most fascinating countries on the planet.<br />

<h2>UEFA Champions League</h2>
<p>Another of the world’s best soccer tournaments, the UEFA Champions League sees the top clubs in Europe battle it out to earn the European Champion Clubs’ Cup. As the most watched annual sporting event in the world, it’s incredibly popular not just in Europe but around the globe. With over 60 years of history behind it, it continues to grow in popularity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/soccer-packages/champions-league-final/">2022 Champions League</a> Final will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia on May 28, 2022 and there’s never been a better reason to visit this beautiful historic city. St. Petersburg Stadium (2018 World Cup host city) will make an excellent host for the 2022 Champions League Final. Regardless of who wins it all next year, we know this will be one exciting tournament.</p>

<h2>UEFA European Championship</h2>
<p>The UEFA European Championship (also known as the Euro) is another quadrennial event and takes place on the even-numbered years between World Cup years. As one of the best soccer tournaments on the continent, it determines the champion of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). A total of 24 national teams qualify to compete for the elusive title of European Champion.</p>
<p>The next edition of the UEFA European Championship will take place in Germany in 2024. A total of ten German cities will host matches, with each host city offering something unique to spectators. It promises to be a spectacular event and one not to miss!</p>
<h2>Women’s World Cup</h2>
<p>Along with the Summer Games Tournament, this is one of the biggest and best soccer tournaments in the world for women. Like the men’s tournament, it is held every four years and always highly anticipated. In 2023, 32 of the best women’s national teams (up from 24 in 2019) will compete over the course of a month for bragging rights to the title of World Cup Champion.</p>
<p>The next Women’s World Cup will take place between July 20 and August 20, 2023 and it’s going to be a good one. Why? Well, it always delivers great soccer and this edition will be held in two of the most beautiful countries in the world: Australia and New Zealand. Nine amazing cities throughout the two countries will act as Women’s World Cup hosts, providing a spectacular backdrop to the popular tournament.<br />
<div id="attachment_24811" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24811" class="wp-image-24811 size-full" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/womens-world-cup.jpg" alt="2019 Women's Worlds in France" width="680"  /><p id="caption-attachment-24811" class="wp-caption-text">2019 Women&#8217;s Worlds in France</p></div></p>
<h2>Copa America Finals</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most passionate festival of soccer in the world, the Copa América is an international tournament primarily for countries in South America, with a reputation for games with stunning atmospheres. Many of the greatest players in soccer history have competed in the tournament, which is the longest-running international competition in the world, predating even the World Cup.</p>
<p>The Copa America has been hosted in many of South America’s most stunning destinations, always with a passionate fan base. Though details have yet to be finalized, it is expected that the next Copa América will be hosted by Ecuador in 2024. </p>
<h2>Copa Libertadores</h2>
<p>The Copa Libertadores is the most prestigious prize in South American domestic soccer, an annual tournament to decide the best club team on the continent. It has always been the biggest competition in South America, but some high-profile and dramatic recent tournaments have seen even more global attention placed on it, in particular the 2018 final which saw historic rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors, from Buenos Aires, battle it out for the trophy.</p>
<p>The final of the 2021 tournament will take place on November 27th. This year, the final will be held in Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay, and while Palmeiras are the current champions, this is one of the most open and exciting tournaments in the world.</p>
<h2>UEFA Europa League</h2>
<p>The sister tournament to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League has gone through many guises in its history but has developed into one of the most open and exciting annual soccer competitions in the world. While the Champions League is home to most of Europe’s established superpowers, the Europa League features a much wider range of new and interesting teams and destinations.</p>
<p>The final of the 2022 Europa League is due to take place in the historic Spanish city of Seville on May 18th, 2022, and the winner not only earns the Europa League trophy, but a place in the following year’s Champions League. Spanish and English teams have dominated the Europa League in recent years, but this is a thrilling soccer tournament that anyone can win.</p>
<h2>Africa Cup of Nations</h2>
<p>The Africa Cup of Nations is a biennial tournament to decide the best international team on the continent of Africa. A total of 24 teams battle it out to determine who is the finest team in Africa, with Egypt the most successful team in the competition’s history with seven wins, and Cameroon not far behind them with five. </p>
<p>The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations will be held in Cameroon from January 9th to February 6th, 2022 after being rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament will be held in six venues across 5 cities in Cameroon, with the final hosted at the newly constructed Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé.</p>
<h2>FA Cup</h2>
<p>The FA Cup is English soccer’s most prestigious knockout tournament and the oldest soccer competition in the world. The first tournament took place in 1871, and in the 150 years since it has remained the biggest and most coveted prize in English domestic soccer. This is the best tournament in the world for an underdog story, as the FA Cup is famous for its upsets, with the smallest teams in the country frequently defeating the biggest and richest.</p>
<p>Leicester City are the current holders, while Arsenal are the most successful team in the competition’s history with 14 victories, closely followed by Manchester United with 12. The final is always held at London’s Wembley Stadium, often regarded as the &#8220;home of soccer.&#8221; The 2022 final will take place on May 14th, 2022.</p>
<h2>Copa Del Rey</h2>
<p>Founded in 1903, the Copa del Rey – or King’s Cup – is the oldest tournament in Spanish soccer and is one of the best and most historic knock-out competitions in the world. For over a century, it has seen some of the biggest and most successful clubs in world soccer compete for the historic annual prize, which predates even Spain’s domestic league competition. </p>
<p>Barcelona are the current holders and most successful team in the competition’s history, having won the Copa del Rey an amazing 31 times, while their historic rivals Real Madrid have won it 19 times. The final of the 2022 Copa del Rey will be held in one of Spain’s many glamorous destinations, which combine a rich sense of soccer history alongside some of the greatest and most desirable cities in the world, like Madrid, Barcelona and Seville.</p>
<h2>Asian Cup</h2>
<p>You could say that the Asian Cup is the biggest regional soccer competition in the world, because it determines the best international team from Asia, the biggest continent on the planet and home to over 4.5 billion people. Held for the first time in 1956, the competition is held every four years in a different Asian country each time. Previous hosts have included Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia, who are part of the Asian Football Confederation. </p>
<p>The current holders are Qatar, who won the 2019 edition held in the United Arab Emirates, while the most successful country in the competition’s history is Japan, who have been successful four times. The 2023 Asian Cup will be held in China, with the final likely to take place in Shanghai. Big soccer tournaments like this are often great ways to explore countries you might not otherwise find easy to visit, so there really is no better opportunity to visit China in 2023.</p>

Doha has been a wonderful destination to indulge in our passion for gastronomy and we love sharing our memorable dining experiences with our guests. Doha has no shortage of wonderful restaurants with more on the horizon. This flourishing city has a little bit of everything in terms of dining, including more than a few big names. We’ve enjoyed testing them out for you and have compiled a list of our favorites, which are detailed below.</p>
<h2>La Mar by Gaston Acurio</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lamar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" />223 Lusail Street<br />
<b>+974 4484 4919</b><br />doha.intercontinental.com/la-mar/</p>
<p>Acurio is a particularly celebrated chef who has helped to introduce Peruvian cuisine<br />
to the world. We’re big fans of La Mar’s location in Miami’s Mandarin Oriental and were excited to try the beachfront Doha eatery.Specialties include ceviches and tiraditos, which are delicious fresh fish dishes that incorporate various fresh fish with juices (usually citrus) and sauces. We also love their Lomo Saltado.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hakkasan</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hakkasan.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0170</b><br />hakkasan.com/doha </p>
<p>Another memorable meal was at Hakkasan, one of Doha’s hottest restaurants. With locations in London, NYC and Miami, it’s pretty famous. Hakkasan is known for having a great vibe and features Michelin star rated Cantonese and Asian fusion food within a nightclub feel. Located at the St. Regis, one of our 2022 World Cup properties, it’s wonderfully convenient for our guests of the property.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nobu</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nobu.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4494 8600</b><br />
www.fourseasons.com/doha/</p>
<p>As one of the most well-known restaurants in the world, we need not wax poetic about Nobu. What makes the Doha eatery a standout is its location at the end of a pier, providing guests with views over the water and back to the Corniche. It’s a pretty spectacular spot.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Astor Grill</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/astor.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0000</b><br />
www.astorgrilldoha.com</p>
<p>If you asked us where to find a great steak in Doha, we’d send you to Astor Grill. Inspired by New York steakhouses, Astor Grill presents a modern version complete with incredible cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and an extensive wine list. Another St. Regis gem.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STK</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stk.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />West Bay Lagoon<br />
<b>+974 4484 8588</b><br />
www.stk-doha.com</p>
<p>Our Ritz-Carlton guests have some incredible restaurants on-site too and STK is one of them. The popular restaurant has about ten outposts worldwide and boasts a club-like atmosphere. It’s a buzzing place with a fun atmosphere and great steak.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toro Toro</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/torotoro-doha.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5101</b><br />
www.torotorodoha.com</p>
<p>Located close to the St. Regis and the Ritz, Toro Toro offers modern Mexican influenced cuisine by Richard Sandoval (foodies may know his name from La Lagune, Brisas at Mayakoba or another of his 30+ restaurants worldwide).</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nozomi</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nozomi.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5089</b><br />
www.nozomi-doha.com</p>
<p>The multiple award winning Nozomi is consistently well rated and a local favorite. It’s<br />
a happening place that offers contemporary Japanese cuisine and spectacular water<br />
views.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spice Market</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spice-market.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4453 5135</b><br />
www.spicemarketdoha.com</p>
<p>The concept is Southeast Asian Street Food in an upscale atmosphere and it definitely<br />
works. Spice Market was named Time Out Doha’s Restaurant of the Year in 2018 and<br />
Best Asian Restaurant in 2019. The menu is extensive and the only downside is not being<br />
able to sample it all.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IDAM</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alain-ducasse.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4422 4488</b><br />
www.mia.org.qa/en/visiting/idam</p>
<p>Located inside the stunning Museum of Islamic Art (MIA), IDAM is Alain Ducasse’s first<br />
restaurant in the Middle East. The menu is mostly French Mediterranean with Arabic<br />
influences. The décor, courtesy of Philippe Starck, provides a memorable backdrop<br />
to the wonderful food. The service and the views are also excellent. The museum is<br />
absolutely worth visiting too!</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doha clearly has some amazing restaurants and there&#8217;s a lot more to love about this incredible city.

To ensure we provide our World Cup clients with the very best of the area, Dave has visited some of the city’s top hotels, met with local partners, checked out some of the coolest attractions and enjoyed Doha’s impressive culinary scene. We’ve included his account of his 2019 trip below, followed by our Doha travel tips and the best things to see and the best things to do in Doha during the 2022 World Cup.</em></p>
<p>Returning to Qatar was something I had been looking forward to for a while. I was eager to check out the progress of new developments to the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doha</a> area in advance of the 2022 World Cup. Doha is thriving and growing with lots of construction and architecturally stunning buildings going up and I was excited to see it for myself.</p>
<h2><strong>Luxury Hotels in Doha, Qatar for the 2022 World Cup</strong></h2>
<p>Visiting <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">our World Cup hotels</a> was a key reason for my trip. In a city that is short on luxury hotel inventory, we have secured some of the best including the Ritz-Carlton Doha. Our wonderful hotels continue to impress me more and more with each visit and I’m confident that they’ll provide an amazing World Cup experience for our guests.</p>
<div id="attachment_31379" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31379" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31379" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ritz-carlton-doha.jpg" alt="Ritz Carlton Hotel Doha" width="715" height="403" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ritz-carlton-doha.jpg 1000w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ritz-carlton-doha-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ritz-carlton-doha-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31379" class="wp-caption-text">Ritz-Carlton Hotel Doha</p></div>
<h2><strong>Accommodation Outlook in Qatar in Advance of the 2022 World Cup</strong></h2>
<p>Though there are some new hotels in the pipeline, it is becoming increasingly evident that demand for hotel rooms is going to exceed supply significantly during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. While host cities often struggle to fulfill the accommodation needs for events of this magnitude, it looks like Qatar is going to be as short of the anticipated demand as we have ever seen. For those looking to attend the 2022 World Cup, it will be more important than ever to plan ahead to avoid disappointment.</p>
<h2><strong>Doha Restaurants</strong></h2>
<p>Doha has no shortage of wonderful restaurants with more on the horizon. I had the pleasure of trying out many of them and there were a few standouts. The first was at <a href="https://doha.intercontinental.com/la-mar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Mar by Gaston Acurio</a>. Acurio is a particularly celebrated chef who has helped to introduce Peruvian cuisine to the world. I&#8217;ve been to this restaurant in Miami a couple of times and it is excellent. In general, I LOVE Peruvian food. Specialities include ceviches and tiraditos, which are delicious fresh fish dishes that incorporate various fresh fish with juices (usually citrus) and sauces.</p>
<p>Another memorable meal was at  <a href="https://hakkasan.com/doha/">Hakkasan</a>, one of Doha’s hottest restaurants, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/qatar/articles/qatar-restaurants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the Telegraph</a>. It&#8217;s at the St. Regis but in its own building. With their restaurants in London, NYC and Miami it&#8217;s pretty famous. These restaurants always have a great vibe and feature Michelin star rated Cantonese and Asian fusion food within a nightclub feel. And that’s just a small taste of the great eateries Doha has to offer. Other big names include <a href="https://www.fourseasons.com/doha/dining/restaurants/nobu_doha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobu</a>, <a href="http://www.stk-doha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STK</a>, <a href="https://www.torotorodoha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toro Toro</a>, <a href="http://www.nozomi-doha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nozomi</a>, <a href="http://pearlsocialdoha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pearl Social</a>, <a href="https://www.spicemarketdoha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spice Market</a>…and <a href="https://www.buddhabar.com/en/blounge/doha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buddha Bar</a> one of the best restaurants in Doha with a view&#8230; I could go on.</p>
<div id="attachment_31380" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31380" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31380 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar.jpg" alt="La Mar Doha Doha's Finest Peruvian Restaurant" width="715" height="496" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar.jpg 715w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31380" class="wp-caption-text">La Mar Doha</p></div>
<h2><strong>Will Alcohol be Allowed in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup?</strong></h2>
<p>Those wondering about Qatar’s alcohol policy and whether they’ll be able to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner will be happy to know the answer is (mostly) yes. The restaurants and bars with a license to serve are usually inside hotels. There are exceptions of course but hotels have the advantage in this respect. There is also some discussion with the government regarding special alcohol licenses being granted to additional eateries specifically for the World Cup period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Best Things to do in Doha for the 2022 World Cup</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve enjoyed our visits to Doha in preparation for the World Cup and we can’t wait for our guests to experience it for themselves. In 2022, thousands of soccer fans will travel to Doha, with many of them experiencing this fascinating city for the first time. Doha is an incredible destination that’s growing in popularity and receiving a lot of attention lately from publications like <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-doha-is-much-more-than-a-stopover-destination?utm_source=nl&amp;utm_brand=cnt&amp;utm_mailing=CNT_Daily_PM_060320&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bxid=5c339b3f2ddf9c392a7a496f&amp;cndid=32104205&amp;hasha=05c5a0eba66fbca40102ae33d3d65686&amp;hashb=d9c7f4461d213a7e563a3fbdc1881f14e456a1b6&amp;hashc=55203e8068be2d7d7aa4f20e06bd0f5e49ebdc20f7aff692c3f5ecf91bac4912&amp;esrc=AUTO_OTHER&amp;utm_content=Final&amp;utm_term=CNT_Daily">Condé Nast Traveler</a>. The World Cup provides the perfect reason to travel to this dynamic, thriving locale.</p>
<p>One of the many great things about Doha is how close it is to everything else in the country. Compact Qatar is a convenient country to explore and despite its size has many unique landscapes and attractions, all within a reasonable drive from the capital city of Doha.</p>
<p>There are so many things to do in Doha, and so much to see, that we’ve created a list to help our guests decide what to visit in Doha and how to best spend their time in this exciting destination.</p>
<h3><strong>Msheireb Downtown Doha</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msheireb_Downtown_Doha">Msheireb </a>is a planned area of downtown Doha and its development is a pretty amazing thing. It consists of 100 buildings all connected by a 10,000 car underground parkade. This $5.5 billion project is home to lots of high-end retail and restaurants that we think our guests will enjoy exploring during the World Cup.</p>
<h3><strong>Doha Top 3 Museums</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-34269 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doha_museum_islamic_art_qatar_2_header-300x169.jpg" alt="museum of islamic art Doha, Qatar attraction" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doha_museum_islamic_art_qatar_2_header-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/doha_museum_islamic_art_qatar_2_header.jpg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Museum of Islamic Art</span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the tourism and public works strategy in Doha is centered on museums and visitors can reap the benefits of these wonderful institutions. The I.M. Pei-designed <a href="http://www.mia.org.qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Museum of Islamic Art </a>is really quite stunning. In addition to the 1,400 years’ worth of Islamic art, there’s also a library featuring specialist books, and a great restaurant as well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;">National Museum of Qatar</span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also noteworthy is the new <a href="https://www.qm.org.qa/en/project/national-museum-qatar">National Museum of Qatar</a>, which opened in 2019 and is a pretty big deal. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it’s worth visiting just to check out the architecture alone. In addition, the museum’s gift shop is a great place to pick up some souvenirs and worth checking out solely for the cool design.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum</span></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://fbqmuseum.org">Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum </a>also makes for an interesting visit. The private museum houses more than 15,000 exhibits from Sheikh Faisal’s personal collection, giving visitors a taste of traditional Qatari life in the pre-oil era.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Souq Waqif</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-34270 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/souq-waqif.jpg" alt="Souq Waqif is Doha's largest market to visit during the Qatar world cup 2022" width="300" height="200" />As Doha’s largest market, you’ll find a little bit of everything at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souq_Waqif">Souq Waqif</a>: traditional Qatari clothing, souvenirs, food, art, home décor, even animals. It is a bit of a maze so it’s worth taking a look at a map first if there are certain items you are looking for. We recommend bringing cash as many vendors will not accept credit cards (and be prepared to barter). Souq Waqif opens at 10am and closes at 10pm, though many shops shut down between 12-4 in the afternoon. Go in the morning for a quiet visit or in the evening for the liveliest atmosphere.</p>
<h3><strong>The Pearl</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Built on a former pearl diving site, The Pearl Qatar is a planned neighborhood/island known for all things luxury. On this man-made island you’ll find high-end residences, international fashion houses, high-end shopping malls, luxury car showrooms, wonderful restaurants, boutique coffee shops, and more. The Pearl also boasts plenty of scenic coastline, perfect for a relaxing walk.</p>
<h4>Top 10 Things to do at the Pearl Qatar:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Pearl-Qatar &#8211; shopping and restaurants</li>
<li>Qanat Quartier &#8211; for a beautiful walk.</li>
<li>Novo Cinemas, The Pearl &#8211; high-end cinema experience</li>
<li>Shakespeare and Co Cafe Restaurant</li>
<li>Medina Centrale &#8211; pedestrian plaza</li>
<li>Alison Nelson&#8217;s Chocolate Bar</li>
<li>Illusion Nightclub &#8211; Dohas superclub</li>
<li>Marsa Malaz Kempinski &#8211; 3 outdoor restaurants</li>
<li>The Ritz-Carlton, Doha hotel</li>
<li>Carluccio&#8217;s &#8211; The Pearl &#8211; luxury Italian</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Camel Racing</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-34271 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/camels.jpg" alt="camel racing is one of Doha cities world cup activities for visitors to try" width="300" height="200" />If you want to experience a unique thing to do around Doha, camel racing might be right up your alley. Al Shahaniya Racetrack is Qatar’s most notable camel racing venue. Races generally take place October through April (usually Fridays and Saturdays) and while it’s a draw for tourists, camel racing is also a popular sport in Qatari culture. The camels are controlled by robot jockeys, adding to the intrigue of the sport. The racetrack is about an hours’ drive from Doha, accessible by rental car or as part of a tour.</p>
<h3><strong>Doha Shopping</strong></h3>
<p>As one of the richest cities in the world, shopping is a favorite pastime of Doha residents. From traditional souqs (markets) like Souq Waqif, to mega-malls to designer boutiques, you’re sure to find a spot to suit your needs. We have little doubt that our guests at the World Cup will be impressed by the sheer number of options available. Another great thing about shopping in Doha: no sales tax!</p>
<h4>Doha Shopping Malls</h4>
<p>Visitors will find no shortage of shopping in Doha. In particular, shopping malls are big in this city, both in terms of popularity and size. <strong>City Center Mall</strong> in Doha’s West Bay is one of the largest. In addition to the 350 stores, the mall also boasts a bowling alley, ice skating rink, a children’s amusement center, 14-screen movie theater, and 38 restaurants. Also popular is <strong>Villaggio Mall</strong> in Doha’s Aspire Zone. It’s attractively designed after Venice, complete with an indoor canal and gondolas, and has a myriad of other attractions in addition to the shopping. Just outside of Doha in Al Rayyan, you’ll find the <strong>Mall of Qatar</strong>. The largest mall in the country is just a few years old and contains 500,000 square meters of shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. A nice bonus to the malls in Doha: the blissful air-conditioning. Complete your shopping experience by returning to one of Doha’s <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">luxury hotels</a>.</p>
<h4>Souqs (markets) in Doha</h4>
<p>One of the best places to do your Doha shopping is in the city’s souqs. The most famous of which is Souq Waqif, as mentioned above. Some other souqs to check out are Souq Al Wakrah, Falcon Souq, and Gold Souq. You can read more about Doha’s wonderful souqs including what you’ll find at each <a href="https://www.iloveqatar.net/guide/places/a-guide-to-the-souqs-and-markets-in-qatar">here</a>. </p>
<h4>Best Dates in Doha</h4>
<p>Dates are staple food in Qatar and if you’re a fan, you’re likely to find some of the best you’ve ever had in Doha. Dates represent more than just sustenance though, they represent abundance; in Qatar as a guest you will often be offered dates and coffee as a show of hospitality. They are a popular gift item and you’ll notice a lot of specialized dates and confectionary in gorgeous boxes during your shopping. Our local hosts will be happy to recommend the best shops near your hotel to find dates.</p>
<h4>Gold Market (Souq) Doha</h4>
<p>While Souq Waqif receives most of the attention in Doha, the nearby Gold Souq (or Gold Market) is extremely popular as well. The name is a bit misleading as it’s closer to a mall than a typical market. Inside, you’ll find an abundance of jewelers selling a variety of items, catering to most budgets.</p>
<h4>Qatar’s Famous Items</h4>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re shopping for yourself or looking for gifts for friends and family back home, Qatar has some unique items that make for great souvenirs including dates, traditional clothing, gold or pearl jewelry, intricate Arabic coffee pots, carved wooden boxes, and tasty sweets.</p>
<h3><strong>The Corniche</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re wondering what else to visit in Doha, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Corniche">the Corniche</a> is great option. This waterfront promenade runs just shy of five miles along Doha Bay. It’s a great place for walking, running, biking, or just some people watching. The Corniche offers some great views of the city, particularly at night when the skyline is lit up. Along the Corniche you’ll find parks and greenspaces, and in the water you’re sure to spot traditional wooden boats called dhows. For a unique perspective of the city, hop on one of the many dhows offering tours of the bay.</p>
<h3><strong>Katara Cultural Village<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-34273 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/katara-cultural-village.jpg" alt="visit katara cultural village during Doha Qatar world cup 2022" width="300" height="200" /></strong></h3>
<p>This purpose-built recreational district is a popular place for events, concerts, and festivals. In addition to its draw as an entertainment destination, there’s a lot to marvel at architecturally, with no shortage of Instagram-worthy photo opportunities. Katara Cultural Village has plenty of coffee shops to sit and relax in as well as a wide variety of restaurant options. If you’re a big shopper, there’s some of that too. There’s even a great public beach. It’s an easy place to spend a full day and a good option for those traveling with families.</p>
<h3><strong>Al Wakrah</strong></h3>
<p>Just a short drive south of Doha is Al Wakrah, a coastal city that has plenty to offer travelers. Visitors can check out its popular Souq Al Wakrah, wander the lovely public gardens, take a stroll along the city’s Corniche (waterfront promenade), or relax on the beaches. As one of the country’s larger cities, Al Wakrah boasts plenty of places for shopping and dining. Al Wakrah is also home to Al Janoub Stadium, one of the venues for the World Cup in 2022.</p>
<h3><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-34274 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/singing-sand-dunes.jpg" alt="Experience the Singing Dunes near Doha, Qatar, during the world cup 2022" width="300" height="200" />The Singing Dunes and Khor Al Adaid</strong></h3>
<p>While Doha has plenty to offer inside the city limits, you’ll need to travel outside of city to experience the singing dunes and the inland sea. As you head southwest from Doha and Al Wakrah, you’ll find a fascinating natural phenomenon known as the singing dunes. Caused by the movement of grains of sand over massive sand dunes, you can hear the singing effect by sliding down the dunes. While it may sound a bit childish, it’s a whole lot of fun and the landscape is pretty cool just to look at. Keep heading south to check out UNESCO-recognized Khor Al Adiad, also known as the inland sea. This unique reserve is one of the few spots in the world where the sea reaches deep into the desert.</p>

<h2>Super Bowl</h2>
<p>While it may be the championship game for American football, the Super Bowl is well-known the world over as one of sport’s biggest parties. Each year, thousands of football fans flock to the Super Bowl’s host city to experience the excitement live, while millions of viewers take it all in on their TVs (over 98 million viewers tuned in to Super Bowl LIII, which is not surprising considering it is one of the most-watched sporting events annually). Super Bowl is so much more than just a game: the anticipation, the pre-game festivities, the half-time show, <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/blog/top-17-things-to-do-in-tampa-super-bowl-2021-weekend/">the host cities attractions</a>…it’s a weekend-long party of all things football.

<h2>Kentucky Derby</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-27088 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-225x300.jpg" alt="Kentucky Derby Mint Juleps" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kentucky-derby-mint-juleps.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />The Kentucky Derby is another of the biggest sporting events in the United States. Each spring, horse enthusiasts converge in Louisville, Kentucky for the first jewel in the triple crown of horse racing. Visitors can spend race week touring horse farms and bourbon distilleries, or mingle with celebrities and other VIPs at some of the biggest social events including the Barnstable Brown Gala. As for the main event, it’s a spectacle like nothing else. Churchill Downs is filled with a lively crowd donning seersucker suits and extravagant hats, while mint juleps are the beverage of the day. It’s a fun atmosphere and it’s difficult not to be swept away in the excitement.</p>

<h2>Monaco Grand Prix</h2>
<p>If you’re a Formula 1 fan, this iconic race is likely already on your bucket list. Arguably the most prestigious event in car racing, the Monaco Grand Prix is a sporting event like no other. In addition to the thrilling race action that winds through the streets of Monte Carlo, Monaco offers exclusive viewing experiences (like watching the race from aboard a luxury yacht or an upscale hospitality venue), legendary parties, world-class dining, and some of the best hotels on the planet. Even if you’re not a huge race fan, Monaco is an event that we wish everyone could have the pleasure of experiencing.</p>

They’re also unique in that they both feature a variety of sports, and thus appeal to millions of people. But the Games are about more than the best athletes in the world competing; they’re about the world coming together and the incredible atmosphere this creates in the host city from the opening ceremony through the closing ceremony. Whether you’re a fan of summer or winter sports, the Games are something truly extraordinary and there really is nothing that compares.</p>

<h2>The World Cup</h2>
<p>In a list of must-see sporting events, the World Cup is a given. It’s the biggest event in soccer, not to mention one of the biggest sporting events in the world. Taking place every four years, the excitement for this event has time to build and when the tournament finally starts, it seems the whole world is watching. So what makes it so great? Well, for starters, you have the best players in the sport playing for national pride and everyone loves rooting for their home team. The competition is fierce and the stakes are high. The World Cup is also a unique event in that it takes place in a number of host cities, giving fans the opportunity to explore some often overlooked destinations within a particular region or country. And then there’s the atmosphere. With the next world cup taking place in Qatar in 2022 see our <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/blog/things-to-see-and-do-in-doha-during-the-2022-world-cup/">things to do in Doha list here</a>.

<h2>College Football Championship</h2>
<p>We know how big college football is in the United States and we knew we couldn’t have a list of must-see sporting events without including it. While it’s hard to pick just one game to feature, the College Football Championship is definitely one of our favorites. We love the opportunity to witness future stars on the biggest stage in college football before they begin their pro career. Another great thing about this event is the timing – taking place in early January, it’s the perfect time of year to get away and have an exciting sports travel experience to look forward to.</p>

<h2>The World Series</h2>
<p>Dating back well over a century, the World Series is one of the most historic and beloved sporting events in the United States. For baseball fans, the sport simply doesn’t get any better. After a hard-fought season, the last two teams remaining battle it out in this best of seven series to determine the best team in baseball. With the series shifting between two host cities, it’s like two events in one. There’s plenty of fanfare surrounding the series, allowing fans to truly immerse themselves in the sport. The World Series is about more than baseball, it’s a beloved celebration of history and tradition.</p>

<h2>The Masters</h2>

It’s one thing to watch it on TV but once you walk the hills of Augusta National and see those rolling greens close up, you’ll fully understand the difficulty of the course. There are also so many Masters traditions to experience: the pimento cheese sandwiches, the souvenir photo, and of course, loading up on official Masters merchandise at the pro shop. To see the top players close up playing at the biggest golf event in the world is an experience that you’ll remember forever.</p>

<h2>Wimbledon</h2>
<p>If you had to pick only one tennis tournament to attend, we highly recommend Wimbledon. Steeped in history and tradition, it draws thousands of fans every year (the total attendance at the 2019 tournament was just over half a million people). The celebrity sightings, the impossibly green courts, the strawberries and cream, and the Pimms are just a few highlights of the tournament. Of course, there’s the world-class tennis too. There is no championship in tennis more prestigious and the action on the court reflects this. As a bonus, there is also the incredible host city of London with its amazing restaurants, endless shopping, and amazing attractions.</p>

<h2>UEFA European Championship</h2>
<p>Soccer tournaments are some of the biggest events in the world and the UEFA European Championship is no exception. Less formally known as the Euro, the tournament takes place quadrennially and involves national teams of the members of UEFA. Like all major soccer tournaments, the excitement and atmosphere surrounding the event is indescribable and there always seems to be lots of related events and celebrations going on in the host cities. The tournament is usually hosted by a single country (or two in a few cases) but the next edition of the Euro will make history as it will be held in 12 cities in 12 different countries for the first time in its history.</p>

It also happens to be a lot of fun to attend. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed and it’s the perfect way to cap off the summer.<br />
As one of four Grand Slam tournaments in the sport, it always draws the top players in the world. Plus, it attracts an incredible number of celebrities each year to cheer on the pros. A big part of what makes the US Open so great is its host city of New York. It’s hard to top The Big Apple in terms of great hotels, entertainment, shopping, and dining. The city offers the best of the best and only serves to enhance the US Open experience.</p>
