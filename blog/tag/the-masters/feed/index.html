Over the last decade, we’ve seen a number of inventive and sophisticated eateries popping up around the city, joining some beloved Augusta classics. The result is a variety of memorable dining experiences for visitors to take advantage of.</p>
<p>We understand how much great meals can add to a travel experience. Discovering remarkable food is one of our favorite things about traveling and we’ve spent plenty of time scouting out some great options for our Masters guests.</p>
<p>After many visits to Augusta and years of delicious research, we’ve listed some of our top Augusta restaurant recommendations below. The diverse list includes options to please virtually any palate. If you’re traveling to the Masters with us, your pre-travel personal concierge would be happy to help out with some custom recommendations based on your tastes.</p>
<h3>Downtown</h3>
<h2>Frog Hollow Tavern</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49883" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.6906</strong><br />
www.froghollowtavern.com<br />
Simply put, it’s one of the best in the city. They just seem to do everything right. The<br />
focus on service is as important as the quality of the food, creating an ideal farm-to-table dining experience. The menu changes seasonally so it’s a new experience every year. There’s an impressive wine list too if you’re so inclined. This is the place to go in Augusta, you’ll need to make reservations well in advance.</p>
<h2>Farmhaus Burger</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49886" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8771</strong><br />
www.farmhausburger.com<br />
This isn’t your average burger. A sister restaurant to Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus serves up gourmet burgers made from locally-sourced ingredients. Agonize over which delicious option to choose from or create your own. Whatever you decide on, we recommend pairing it with the housemade sweet potato tots. Fun, casual, and they even have gluten free options. There is a second location in Flowing Wells.</p>
<h2>Craft &#038; Vine</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49888" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8442</strong><br />
craftandvine.com<br />
The third member of the Frog Hollow Tavern family is Craft &#038; Vine. This downtown cocktail bar serves up flavorful small plates and wood-fired pizzas. Open late, it’s a great place for a nightcap; sip on a handcrafted cocktail or a great glass of wine while<br />
reminiscing about a great day of golf.</p>
<h2>The Boll Weevil Café</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49889" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.722.7772</strong><br />
www.thebollweevil.com<br />
Ask anyone in Augusta where to go for dessert and you’ll likely be directed to the Boll Weevil. Yes, they offer lunch and dinner as well but the long list of sweet treats are the highlight. We’d recommend our favorite dessert but it’s impossible to pick just one. Its proximity to the Riverwalk makes it a nice spot for a refreshment if you’re in the area.</p>
<h3>Surrey Center</h3>
<h2>Calvert’s</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49890" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.4514</strong><br />
calvertsrestaurant.net<br />
Calvert’s is the reigning fine dining choice in Augusta. A long time favorite of both our<br />
clients and our staff, it’s the best place in town for steak and seafood. The service is<br />
impeccable, the food is superb, and the wine list is the best in the city. Calvert’s is an<br />
Augusta landmark; you’ll need to make reservations well ahead for this one, particularly<br />
for Masters week.</p>
<h2>Finch &#038; Fifth</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49891" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.5300</strong><br />
www.finchandfifth.com<br />
Augusta has been blessed with a number of creative new restaurants in the last decade<br />
and Finch &#038; Fifth is one of them. The dishes are mostly modern takes on Southern<br />
classics and there’s also a charcuterie and cheese menu. Good food and drink, friendly,<br />
unpretentious.</p>
<h2>Abel Brown Southern Kitchen &#038; Oyster Bar</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49892" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.6491</strong><br />
www.abelbrownaugusta.com<br />
Chef Todd Schafer has been a staple on the Augusta restaurant scene for many years<br />
and Abel Brown is his latest venture. The oysters are excellent but so is everything else<br />
we’ve tried. We think it’s well-deserving of the phenomenal reviews it’s received over<br />
the years.</p>
<h2>Oliviana</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49893" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-723-1242</strong><br />
www.olivianaitaliano.com<br />
This great eatery boasts some of our favorite pizza in Augusta. If you’re not in the mood<br />
for pizza, Oliviana’s Italian menu is extensive and you’re sure to find something that will<br />
make your mouth water. Small and intimate, Oliviana’s atmosphere is as enjoyable as<br />
the food. They’re open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.</p>
<h3>Village West</h3>
<h2>Edgar’s Grille</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49894" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-854-4700</strong><br />
www.edgarsgrille.com<br />
Edgar’s serves up New American cuisine with a southern flair and their farm-to-table<br />
dishes are wonderful. Whatever dish piques your interest, be sure to complement it<br />
with a side of truffle fries. Edgar’s Grille is one of our favorites and it’s more than just<br />
a restaurant. It’s also a training center for culinary students at Helms College. The<br />
restaurant gives back a portion of their profits toward local education programs, in case<br />
you needed another great reason to eat here.</p>
<h2>Cork &#038; Flame</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49887" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-922-9463</strong><br />
www.corkandflame.com<br />
Cork &#038; Flame combines fine dining, small bites, and one of the largest wine<br />
selections in the area with close to 3,000 labels. The dining room offers self-described<br />
“Progressive American Cuisine,” which can be enjoyed a la carte, as part of a fourcourse tasting menu, or as the eight-course chef’s table experience. The Cork &#038; Flame<br />
also has a fairly extensive vegetarian menu, making it a great option for plant-based<br />
eaters.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Masters week is a busy week for restaurants in Augusta and we recommend making reservations well in advance (think months, not weeks) to avoid missing out. It’s important to note that many restaurants have strict reservation policies for this particular week. Augusta has some amazing restaurants and we hope you’ll enjoy trying them out as much as we have. </p>

Some of its traditions are well known, others not so much. Many of the questions we get from our <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/professional-golf-packages/masters/">Masters</a> guests are about how to get the most out of their visit, including how to navigate its celebrated customs and traditions. We’ve learned a lot from our many visits to Augusta and have compiled some information to help all of those who hope to experience this iconic tournament one day.</p>
<h2>The Merch</h2>
<p>Official Masters merchandise is only available at Augusta National during Masters week. The question isn’t whether you will buy something, it’s when and how much. No doubt you’ll have a long list of requests from friends and family but when to buy it all will require some careful planning. Buy it too early and you’ll be lugging it around with you all day. Buy it too late in the tournament and you’ll find little selection left. It’s a fine line and the struggle is real. Your brother-in-law and your friends at the club are counting on you.</p>
<h2>The Food</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg" alt="masters pimento cheese sandwich" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47603" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Most first time visitors are shocked at the food and drink prices at Augusta National. Not because they’re so high, because they are so wildly inexpensive. You’ll feel like you’re in a different era. Where else in the world of sport can you grab a beer and one of those famous pillowy soft pimento cheese sandwiches for just $5.50?</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Chairs</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg" alt="masters chairs" width="300" height="158" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47605" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want to sit down somewhere other than the grandstands on Augusta National, you’ll want to purchase or bring along a chair (but you’ll need to make sure it’s collapsible and doesn’t have armrests – Augusta National is strict with their rules). We definitely recommend buying a Masters chair; few things are more fun than showing up at a summer event and nonchalantly putting down your green Masters-logoed chair. “Oh yeah, that’s right, I did go the Masters this year.” Spots are first come, first serve. Many patrons (as you’ve likely noticed on TV, Masters attendees are referred to as patrons, never fans) will claim their spot early in the day and come and go as they please. There’s no need to worry about someone taking your chair or spot, that’s simply unheard of at this event and one of the many joys of the Masters. If you plan to plant a chair on Sunday for the lucky golfer’s emotional walk up 18, you will need to be there very early. It’s coveted real estate on Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>As with anything related to the great game of golf, it is important to know the rules. Masters patrons are keen observers of the etiquette and rules of this well-heeled event. Don’t worry, before you go we’ll send you a complete list of items that you can and can’t bring with you, like no phones or cameras after the practice rounds conclude. So for now, politeness rules the day, decorum is the modus operandi, and make sure your golf outfit is properly matched. </p>
<h2>The Souvenir Photo</h2>
<p>You know how they say you can’t get a picture during the Masters? Well, that’s not entirely true. To be clear, we are not recommending flouting the very serious rule about cameras. Instead, as you are making your way towards the Par 3 Course, you will likely see a line forming near the first hole. This is the picture line. Right near Founders Circle the Club will take your picture with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background. After they have taken your picture, they will give you a small plastic card that will allow you to retrieve the picture online later. Apart from the time spent, it won’t cost you a thing. </p>
<h2>The Big Decision</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg" alt="augusta masters field" width="300" height="179" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47606" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-1024x612.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-768x459.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For many people the highlight of the tournament is watching the last few deciding holes on Sunday afternoon. The anticipation and excitement is there and the whole week often comes down to the back nine at Augusta. While most patrons want to stay to experience this live, it makes for a challenge to find a good spot to view the action from. In fact, many patrons will leave early and head to a hospitality venue or somewhere else where they can watch the action on TV to guarantee themselves a great view. Should you stay or should you go? It’s something you may want to think about before Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Hospitality</h2>
<p>To do hospitality or not do hospitality, that is the question. This is something that is very much personal preference and another unique aspect that makes Augusta special. Unlike any other golf event, there is no hospitality on the course at Augusta National. This has created a variety of offsite hospitality venues, each with their own strengths. Roadtrips partners with the most solid hospitality providers and we can match you with the most well suited option. </p>
<h2>The Extensions</h2>
<p>After a few days on a golf high, we know first hand how hard it is to head back to real life. Instead, many of our clients choose to extend their trip with a few extra days in Hilton Head, Savannah, or a number of other golf destinations in the area.</p>
