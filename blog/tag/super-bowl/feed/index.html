Next year, the Super Bowl will take place at Raymond James Stadium in sunny Tampa, Florida. Not only does Tampa offer a reprieve from the winter cold for northerners, it also boasts a ton of fun things to see and do. From theme parks to museums to natural beauty, there are plenty of ways to keep yourself entertained. Here is our list of things to do in Tampa:</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46274 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens-300x200.jpg" alt="Busch Gardens Elephants and other Zoo animals in Tampa Florida." width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/busch-gardens.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Busch Gardens Tampa Bay</strong></h2>
<p>Florida is known for many things, and theme parks are just one of them. One of the biggest in the state is <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/">Busch Gardens</a>. If you’re a roller coaster fan, you’ll definitely want to check it out as it is home to some of the most thrilling coasters around. In addition to the <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/rides/">rides</a>, Busch Gardens is home to over 200 species of animals at its <a href="https://buschgardens.com/tampa/zoo/animals/">zoo</a>, known as one of the best in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46278 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk-300x225.jpg" alt="Tampa city Hillsborough river walk near Hillsborough Bay Florida." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-riverwalk.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Tampa Riverwalk</strong></h2>
<p>For those who love exploring destinations on foot, the Tampa Riverwalk is the perfect spot. This 2.4-mile pedestrian-friendly path connects visitors to museums, shops, restaurants, attractions, and greenspaces along the water. With views of both the river and downtown, the Tampa Riverwalk is an ideal place for a stroll, jog, or leisurely bike ride. You can even plan your visit before you go with <a href="https://tampa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=b714f0a636c540a5b3f6cd669d0cdb4b">this virtual Riverwalk tour</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Florida Aquarium<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46291 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium-300x225.jpg" alt="The Florida Aquarium, Sharks, Turtles and Conger Eels for family to see in Tampa." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tampa-aquarium.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.flaquarium.org/">Florida Aquarium</a> is home to over 9,000 aquatic animals. It’s a great place to get an up-close view of some incredible sea creatures. The aquarium is located in downtown Tampa and offers a number of events and experiences you can take advantage of. There is also a café and gift shop on-site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46280 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard-300x225.jpg" alt="Bayshore Boulevard along downtown Tampa waterfront things to do like walking and water views." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bayshore-boulevard.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Bayshore Boulevard</strong></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, Bayshore Boulevard runs along the waterfront, just south of downtown Tampa. Bayshore is another option for those looking for a place to walk, run, or ride. It also makes for a scenic drive if you have a rental car. Take in panoramic water views on one side or check out stunning homes on the other. Unlike the Riverwalk, there’s not a lot of places to visit along the way, but at 4.5 miles long it’s ideal for exercising or a relaxing walk. In fact, it claims to be the <a href="https://www.tampagov.net/parks-and-recreation/programs/parks-and-facilities/greenways-and-trails/projects-under-development/bayshore-boulevard-greenway">country’s longest continuous sidewalk</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This fun and eclectic neighborhood is a National Historic Landmark District with a history dating back to the 1880s. Also known as Tampa’s Latin Quarter, it began as a cigar hub (earning Tampa the nickname <a href="https://www.visittampabay.com/cigar-history/">Cigar City</a>) after prominent cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor settled there. Since then, Ybor City has become a popular destination for both visitors and locals, housing trendy boutiques, great restaurants, bars with live music, and historic buildings. There’s plenty of evidence of its beginnings in the cigar factory industry including the <a href="https://www.ybormuseum.org/visit-the-museum">Ybor City Museum</a>.</p>
