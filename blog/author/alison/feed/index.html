Over the last decade, we’ve seen a number of inventive and sophisticated eateries popping up around the city, joining some beloved Augusta classics. The result is a variety of memorable dining experiences for visitors to take advantage of.</p>
<p>We understand how much great meals can add to a travel experience. Discovering remarkable food is one of our favorite things about traveling and we’ve spent plenty of time scouting out some great options for our Masters guests.</p>
<p>After many visits to Augusta and years of delicious research, we’ve listed some of our top Augusta restaurant recommendations below. The diverse list includes options to please virtually any palate. If you’re traveling to the Masters with us, your pre-travel personal concierge would be happy to help out with some custom recommendations based on your tastes.</p>
<h3>Downtown</h3>
<h2>Frog Hollow Tavern</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49883" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/frog-hollow-tavern.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.6906</strong><br />
www.froghollowtavern.com<br />
Simply put, it’s one of the best in the city. They just seem to do everything right. The<br />
focus on service is as important as the quality of the food, creating an ideal farm-to-table dining experience. The menu changes seasonally so it’s a new experience every year. There’s an impressive wine list too if you’re so inclined. This is the place to go in Augusta, you’ll need to make reservations well in advance.</p>
<h2>Farmhaus Burger</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49886" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/farmhaus-burger.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8771</strong><br />
www.farmhausburger.com<br />
This isn’t your average burger. A sister restaurant to Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus serves up gourmet burgers made from locally-sourced ingredients. Agonize over which delicious option to choose from or create your own. Whatever you decide on, we recommend pairing it with the housemade sweet potato tots. Fun, casual, and they even have gluten free options. There is a second location in Flowing Wells.</p>
<h2>Craft &#038; Vine</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49888" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/craft-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.496.8442</strong><br />
craftandvine.com<br />
The third member of the Frog Hollow Tavern family is Craft &#038; Vine. This downtown cocktail bar serves up flavorful small plates and wood-fired pizzas. Open late, it’s a great place for a nightcap; sip on a handcrafted cocktail or a great glass of wine while<br />
reminiscing about a great day of golf.</p>
<h2>The Boll Weevil Café</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49889" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/boll-weevil.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.722.7772</strong><br />
www.thebollweevil.com<br />
Ask anyone in Augusta where to go for dessert and you’ll likely be directed to the Boll Weevil. Yes, they offer lunch and dinner as well but the long list of sweet treats are the highlight. We’d recommend our favorite dessert but it’s impossible to pick just one. Its proximity to the Riverwalk makes it a nice spot for a refreshment if you’re in the area.</p>
<h3>Surrey Center</h3>
<h2>Calvert’s</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49890" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/calverts.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.4514</strong><br />
calvertsrestaurant.net<br />
Calvert’s is the reigning fine dining choice in Augusta. A long time favorite of both our<br />
clients and our staff, it’s the best place in town for steak and seafood. The service is<br />
impeccable, the food is superb, and the wine list is the best in the city. Calvert’s is an<br />
Augusta landmark; you’ll need to make reservations well ahead for this one, particularly<br />
for Masters week.</p>
<h2>Finch &#038; Fifth</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49891" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finch-fifth.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.364.5300</strong><br />
www.finchandfifth.com<br />
Augusta has been blessed with a number of creative new restaurants in the last decade<br />
and Finch &#038; Fifth is one of them. The dishes are mostly modern takes on Southern<br />
classics and there’s also a charcuterie and cheese menu. Good food and drink, friendly,<br />
unpretentious.</p>
<h2>Abel Brown Southern Kitchen &#038; Oyster Bar</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49892" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/able-brown.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706.738.6491</strong><br />
www.abelbrownaugusta.com<br />
Chef Todd Schafer has been a staple on the Augusta restaurant scene for many years<br />
and Abel Brown is his latest venture. The oysters are excellent but so is everything else<br />
we’ve tried. We think it’s well-deserving of the phenomenal reviews it’s received over<br />
the years.</p>
<h2>Oliviana</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49893" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/olivianas.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-723-1242</strong><br />
www.olivianaitaliano.com<br />
This great eatery boasts some of our favorite pizza in Augusta. If you’re not in the mood<br />
for pizza, Oliviana’s Italian menu is extensive and you’re sure to find something that will<br />
make your mouth water. Small and intimate, Oliviana’s atmosphere is as enjoyable as<br />
the food. They’re open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.</p>
<h3>Village West</h3>
<h2>Edgar’s Grille</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49894" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edgar-grille.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-854-4700</strong><br />
www.edgarsgrille.com<br />
Edgar’s serves up New American cuisine with a southern flair and their farm-to-table<br />
dishes are wonderful. Whatever dish piques your interest, be sure to complement it<br />
with a side of truffle fries. Edgar’s Grille is one of our favorites and it’s more than just<br />
a restaurant. It’s also a training center for culinary students at Helms College. The<br />
restaurant gives back a portion of their profits toward local education programs, in case<br />
you needed another great reason to eat here.</p>
<h2>Cork &#038; Flame</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49887" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cork-vine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>706-922-9463</strong><br />
www.corkandflame.com<br />
Cork &#038; Flame combines fine dining, small bites, and one of the largest wine<br />
selections in the area with close to 3,000 labels. The dining room offers self-described<br />
“Progressive American Cuisine,” which can be enjoyed a la carte, as part of a fourcourse tasting menu, or as the eight-course chef’s table experience. The Cork &#038; Flame<br />
also has a fairly extensive vegetarian menu, making it a great option for plant-based<br />
eaters.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Masters week is a busy week for restaurants in Augusta and we recommend making reservations well in advance (think months, not weeks) to avoid missing out. It’s important to note that many restaurants have strict reservation policies for this particular week. Augusta has some amazing restaurants and we hope you’ll enjoy trying them out as much as we have. </p>

<h3>Qatar Travel Tips</h3>
<p>Wondering what to expect during your visit to Qatar for the World Cup? Our staff has made multiple visits to Qatar in preparation for the event, each time discovering more about the country. Below we’ve detailed what we’ve learned about Qatar and its culture to help you plan your trip and enjoy your visit.</p>
<h3>All About Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49527" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a fascinating destination and the 2022 World Cup is the perfect reason to travel to this dynamic, thriving country. Qatar, and specifically its capital Doha, offers a wonderful blend of stunning, ultramodern high rises and 100-year-old cultural heritage sites, an enchanting mix of old and new. Plus, there are so many memorable experiences for visitors within a few hours’ drive of the capital. You can read about some of our top recommendations in our blog <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/things-to-see-and-do-in-doha-during-the-2022-world-cup/">“Things to See and Do in Doha During the 2022 World Cup.”</a></p>
<h3>During your Visit</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49529" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/safety-qatar.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We think our guests will immediately feel comfortable in Qatar. The people are friendly and welcoming. Crime is incredibly rare, and in fact, Doha was recently named <a href="https://www.luxurytravelmagazine.com/news-articles/doha-ranks-second-safest-city-in-the-world">one of the safest cities in the world</a>. English is widely spoken, largely due Doha’s sizable expat population. Much of the signage around the city is in English, which makes getting around and communicating a breeze compared to other foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Dining in Qatar</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-31380" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg" alt="La Mar Doha" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/la-mar.jpg 715w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of our favorite things about Qatar is the food. Doha has some wonderful world-class eateries including big names like Hakkasan, Nobu and Morimoto. The list of notable restaurants is long and we’ve enjoyed trying out as many as we can. So much so that we wrote a whole blog about it <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/best-restaurants-in-doha-for-the-2022-world-cup/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>Those wondering about Qatar’s alcohol policy and whether they’ll be able to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner will be happy to know the answer is yes. In fact, there are many famous bars and restaurants — primarily in hotels — that serve the same handcrafted cocktails you’d find in other global travel hot spots.</p>
<h3>Tipping</h3>
<p>While tipping is not a traditional practice in Qatar, it has become more common due to the large expat population. Often a service charge will be included on your bill when dining out. If not, a tip at your discretion is usually appreciated.</p>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28694" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/St-Regis-Doha-lobby2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We are very particular about hotels and fortunately Qatar has some wonderful options from intimate boutique-style properties to five-star beach resorts. Our World Cup guests have access to some of the best hotels in the country including the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">Ritz-Carlton Doha</a> and the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/hotels/">St. Regis Doha</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting Around Qatar for the World Cup</h3>
<p>Doha is in the process of completing a state-of-the-art rapid transit system (Doha Metro) that is being lauded as one of the most advanced rail transportation systems in the world. Complete with first-class sections (called Gold Club), Doha Metro’s modern trains can transport passengers up to 100km/h, bypassing bad traffic. With a system designed specifically for the tournament, the Doha Metro will be the most efficient way to traverse the city and access the stadiums during the 2022 World Cup.</p>
<h3>Weather in Qatar</h3>
<p>World Cup organizers have meticulously planned the event to ensure that players and spectators can enjoy comfortable weather during the tournament. The 2022 World Cup was moved from its traditional summer dates to Qatar’s winter in order to take advantage of the more enjoyable temperatures. The 2022 World Cup will take place from November 21 to December 18, when temperatures average 68-86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30°C). In addition, all the World Cup host stadiums have been constructed with cooling systems.</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49487" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tour-souq-waqif.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Qatar is a conservative country and you’ll find many of the locals dressed in traditional clothing. While visitors are not expected to dress in the same manner, it is recommended to be sensitive to their culture by dressing modestly. This includes keeping shoulders, upper arms and knees covered. Swimwear is acceptable on the beach or by the pool.</p>
<p>Qatar is a warm and unique place, and quickly growing as a tourist destination. We’re confident that our guests will love exploring Qatar as much as we have. We look forward to sharing all of our favorite things about this wonderful country as it acts as host to the biggest soccer tournament in the world.</p>

Of the four grand slam tournaments in professional tennis (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open), Wimbledon always seems to attract the most attention. It seems to be a favorite major tennis tournament of the players too; American <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-best-tournament-in-world-sam-querrey-masters-a7825536.html">Sam Querrey notably referred to it as the best tournament</a>, comparing it to golf’s iconic Masters.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Major Tennis Tournaments to Attend</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Wimbledon – All England Club, London (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>It only makes sense to start the list of top tennis tournaments with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/05/30/what-is-the-most-prestigious-grand-slam-tennis-tournament/#1f09d9cf7696">most famous (and prestigious) tennis tournament</a> in the world. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/a-guide-to-the-wimbledon-championships/">Wimbledon</a> dates back to the year 1877 when the first tournament was played on the grass lawns of the All England Club just outside of London, England.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32789" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon-300x225.jpg" alt="major tennis tournaments of Wimbledon" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wimbledon.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wimbledon is still played on grass courts, one of many long-standing traditions of this historic tournament. Appearances by the Royal Family (and other celebrities), fresh strawberries and cream, and the famous all-white dress code are other traditions that have become associated with the tournament.</p>
<p>One of the four major tennis tournaments (also known as grand slams), Wimbledon takes place over two weeks in late June/early July. It attracts a long list of the best tennis players in the world and has hosted some of the sport’s <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2514250-ranking-the-10-most-iconic-moments-in-wimbledon-history#slide1">most iconic matches</a> on the All England Club’s famous Centre Court.</p>

<h3><strong>US Open – National Tennis Center, New York (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>Usually the last Grand Slam of the season, the US Open is also the most famous professional US tennis tournament. The US Open was first played in 1881 as the US National Championship. What makes it one of the best tennis tournaments to attend? Well for starters, it offers a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/us-open-best-matches/what-makes-us-open-special/">different and unique atmosphere</a> than the other majors. It’s lively, fun, and exuberant, just like its host city, New York.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32461" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-300x200.jpg" alt="top tennis tournaments ar the US National Tennis Center" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-open-winner-bianca-andreescu.jpg 848w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This top tennis tournament takes place at the US National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, NY, though many fans will <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/first-class-hotels/">stay in Manhattan</a> and take advantage of the city’s incredible dining, shopping, and entertainment when they’re not checking out the tennis. Just like Wimbledon, you’ll find no shortage of <a href="https://people.com/sports/celebrities-at-the-2021-us-open/">celebrity presence</a> at the US Open.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/">US Open</a> plays out each year in late <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/us-open-tennis/schedule/">August/early September</a> and we think it’s the perfect way to wrap up the summer. We’re not the only ones that think so. In 2021, the tournament attracted <a href="https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2021-09-12/us_open_final_by_the_numbers.html">a total of 631,134</a> tennis fans, who experienced the event in person. </p>

<h3><strong>Australian Open – Melbourne Park, Melbourne (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>The first of the four major tennis tournaments on the calendar, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/australian-open/">Australian Open</a> is a bucket list event for fans around the world. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open">the largest annual sporting event in the Southern hemisphere</a> and has taken place at Melbourne Park since 1988, though the tournament dates back to 1905.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16779" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open-300x200.jpg" alt="biggest tennis tournaments Australian open" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/australian-open.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Australian Open is played on a hard-court surface and has been dominated by Novak Djokovic in recent years. He’s won the tournament nine times since 2008, giving him the record of most singles titles at the event.</p>
<p>As the first grand slam of the year, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/australian-open/schedule/">excitement is always high</a> for this famous Melbourne tennis event and as one of the highest attended, it definitely makes the list of best tennis tournaments.<strong> </strong></p>

<h3><strong>French Open – Roland Garros, Paris (Grand Slam Event)</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/french-open/">French Open</a> is different from the other major tennis tournaments in that it is the only one played on clay courts. Clay is known to be a <a href="https://www.ertheo.com/blog/en/type-tennis-courts/">difficult surface to play on</a>, due to the slower moving ball. Some players seem to excel on the clay, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, who won has an incredible thirteen French Open Championships.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-16320" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open-300x200.jpg" alt="best tennis tournaments French open" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/main-french-open.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the best parts about the French Open is the amazing city of Paris. There’s a reason it is regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-08/the-50-most-beautiful-cities-in-the-world">most beautiful cities in the world</a>. With its charming cafés, amazing food, great hotels, and stunning architecture, it makes an ideal backdrop for one of the best tennis tournaments in the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/tennis-packages/french-open/schedule/">2022 French Open tennis tournament dates are</a> May 22nd to June 5th. With a history dating back 130 years, this tournament has been home to hundreds of memorable moments.</p>

<h3><strong>The Summer Games – Roland Garros, Paris</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/">Summer Games</a> is unique in that it’s more than just a major tennis tournament. The best thing about the Summer Games tennis tournament is that fans can take in so many other incredible sporting events in one city surrounded by an incomparable atmosphere.</p>
<p>Tennis made its first Summer Games appearance at the inaugural event in 1896 but was later dropped in 1924. It returned in 1988 and has remained in the lineup ever since.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/">The 2024 Summer Games are in Paris, France,</a> and will take place July 26 to August 11, 2024. When tennis fans aren’t checking out the tennis action, they can watch the best athletes in the world compete in 31 other sports or explore the incredible country of France.</p>

<h3><strong>BNP Paribas Open – Indian Wells Tennis Garden, Indian Wells</strong></h3>
<p>There are many reasons we consider the BNP Paribas Open to be one of the top tennis tournaments. The first is, of course, the tennis itself. This major tennis tournament attracts the top players in the world, and is a favorite with fans as well. It regularly draws over 400,000 fans and in fact, <a href="https://bnpparibasopen.com/tournament/history/2011-present/">set an attendance record</a> at the 2019 tournament with 475,372 fans experiencing the tournament in person.</p>
<p>Another draw of the BNP Paribas Open is its location. The tournament refers to itself as <a href="https://bnpparibasopen.com/news/welcome-to-tennis-paradise/">“Tennis Paradise”</a> and it’s hard to argue that. The event takes place in Indian Wells, in the Palm Springs area of California. This stunning tourist destination offers luxury resorts, world-class golf, incredible shopping and dining, high-end spas, and plenty to appease the nature lovers. It also boasts wonderful weather, the perfect spot for a late winter getaway.</p>
<h3><strong>ATP Finals – Pala Alpitour Stadium, Turin</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nittoatpfinals.com/">ATP Finals</a> are another top tennis tournament. The ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) Finals date back to 1970, though it has gone through a few different names and versions since then. Since 2009, the tournament has been held at O2 Stadium in London, though this year it moves <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/48036923">to a new host city: Turin, Italy</a>.  </p>
<p>The ATP Finals follow a different format than the grand slams, which use a knock-out/bracket system. This event follows a group stage format. Each player is put into a group of four and plays each other player in his group. The top two from each group move on to a semi-final and then the championship final match.</p>
<h3><strong>WTA Finals – Panamerican Tennis Center, Guadalajara</strong></h3>
<p>The professional women have their own major tournament to cap off their season. The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour concludes with the WTA Finals, scheduled to take place in Guadalajara, Mexico from November 10-17, 2021. Shenzhen was awarded hosting duties until 2028, though the 2021 tournament was moved to Guadalajara due to COVID-19 concerns in China.</p>
<p>Similar to the ATP Finals, the tournament is played as a group-stage/round-robin format, followed by the semi-finals and finals. In 2019, the WTA Finals made history by offering the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/tennis/wta-finals-tennis-prize-money-china-spt-intl/index.html">biggest prize money in the sport’s history</a>, with a possible $4.75 million for the winner. To win the full amount, the winner would need to go undefeated in the tournament. In the end, singles winner Ashleigh Barty walked away with a cool <a href="https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/11/ashleigh-barty-elina-svitolina-wta-finals-shenzhen-record-prize-purse-breakthrough/85790/">$4.42 million</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Laver Cup – O2 Stadium, London</strong></h3>
<p>Named after popular Australian tennis pro Rod Laver, the Laver Cup is a relative newcomer to the tennis scene. The inaugural tournament took place in 2017 and it has been held annually since then, with the exception of 2020 due to COVID-19. The Laver Cup is a weekend tournament that pits players from Europe against players from the rest of the world. Each of the two teams (Team Europe and Team World) are comprised of six players: three that qualify based on their ranking and three that are chosen by team captains. John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg have served as Team Captains since the tournament began. </p>
<p>The location of the Laver Cup alternates between Europe and the rest of the world, with the 2022 tournament taking place in London. It’s a fun event and it’s always played on an indoor court, or one with a retractable roof, so there’s no worry about getting rained out.</p>

Wondering which are the most watched sporting events in the world?</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>1. Tour de France &#8211; 3.5 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>The preeminent event in cycling takes place each summer in France. In addition to being one of the most prestigious competitions in the sport, it is also one of the most difficult with a course that winds through the country’s scenic mountain roads. The race consists of 21 stages totaling approximately 2,200 miles, raced over 23 days. Competitors race as part of an 8-person team, working together to achieve the fastest cumulative time.</p>
<p>Dating way back to 1903, the Tour de France has become one of the biggest events in the sporting world. A <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/racing/g20037343/14-questions-youve-always-had-about-the-tour-de-france/ ">recent article</a> estimates that 3.5 billion viewers worldwide tune in to watch the Tour de France every year.</p>

<p>In the same company as the Summer Games, the World Cup is right up there at the top in terms of popularity. This 32-team tournament (which will be <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/chicago-fire/fifa-approves-world-cup-expansion-48-teams-beginning-2026">expanded to 48 teams</a> in 2026) features national soccer teams from around the globe competing until ultimately one team is crowned champion. Held quadrennially, the World Cup is the pinnacle event in the sport and boasts huge attendance numbers every year. The 1950 Final game holds the record for attendance at a sporting event in an enclosed stadium with a whopping 199,854 spectators.</p>
<p>In terms of TV viewership, the World Cup numbers are regularly in the billions, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/world-cup-2018-half-the-worlds-population-tuned-in-to-this-years-soccer-tournament.html">3.262 billion</a> (that’s half the world’s population!) tuning in in 2018.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>3. Cricket World Cup &#8211; 2.6 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>North Americans may be surprised to find cricket on a list of most watched sporting events, but fans of the sport are well aware of how hugely popular cricket is in many parts of the world. The Cricket World Cup is the international championship for One Day International cricket. The contest features ten teams and lasts just over six weeks. Like the soccer World Cup, the tournament takes place every four years, with the next Cricket World Cup scheduled for 2023 in India.</p>
<p>The 2019 Cricket World Cup, hosted by England and Wales, set a new record for viewership. An incredible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_television_broadcasts">2.6 billion people</a> tuned in, making it the most watched cricket event of all time.</p>
<p>Next Cricket World Cup: February 9 – March 26, 2023 in India</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>4. Summer Games &#8211; 2 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the Summer Games are one of the most anticipated sporting events in the world. The Games not only offer a variety of different sports to watch, they also feature incredible personal triumphs, underdog stories, record-breaking feats of strength and endurance, and the opportunity to showcase national pride. With people around the world eager to cheer on their home country, it is no wonder billions of people want to spectate.</p>
<p>Every four years, the Summer Games are hosted in one of the world’s most attractive destinations, contributing to it being one of the highest attended sporting events. With a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/10-most-watched-sport-events-in-the-history-of-television_uk_5c7e84e8e4b06e0d4c22eebc?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAZjFUduoxqfvPXkmBeeFLePNQ_oR-WHHGl6Zq53yApx43hUz2uTGiE1APBdV9HOrwdX3rhnpvCa7jl4SKc0wKVqabGKgfkOwe36gaiRyX1QFWbGmHDpY4BnA_cibhu4MaBp5iiqHzT_X7_ZhewkZzi4R1cUbu3WYLaQcObQTJhr">global average reach of 2 billion viewers</a>, it’s also one of the most watched on TV.</p>

<p>Though it may not attract the same amount of attention as the Summer Games, the Winter Games are still a hugely popular event that draws interest from around the globe. With popular sports including figure skating, alpine skiing, ice hockey, and snowboarding, the Games reaches a broad audience. The Winter Games take place over a 17-day period every four years. The next edition of the Winter Games will take place in 2022 in Beijing, China, which will become the first destination to host both a Summer and Winter Games.</p>
<p>A quarter of the world’s population (1.92 billion people) <a href="https://sportcal.com/News/FeaturedNews/117906">tuned in</a> to watch a portion of the 2018 Winter Games, down slightly from the previous event in 2014, which drew 2.06 billion.</p>

<p>Women’s soccer is becoming more and more popular and as a result, the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France attracted a lot of interest. Following a similar format as the men’s tournament, national teams compete in a month-long tournament that begins with group-stage matches and ends with a knockout stage (playoff rounds).</p>
<p>With a hugely popular Team USA playing for first place, it makes sense that so many Americans wanted to watch the matches. But it wasn’t just Americans tuning in. The 2019 tournament smashed previous viewing records, with an incredible <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanaglass/2019/10/21/fifa-womens-world-cup-breaks-viewership-records/#1af948641884">1.12 billion watching worldwide</a>. It will be interesting to see if the numbers are even bigger at the next tournament in 2023.</p>
<p>Next Women’s World Cup: July 20 &#8211; August 20, 2023 in Australia and New Zealand</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>7. Boxing &#8211; 1 Billion Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Boxing is a fascinating sport. Casual observers may not hear much about the sport from day to day but the moment a major match is announced it draws huge attention from around the globe. Viewership is often measured by pay-per-view buys and these big-name bouts put up huge numbers.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, known as “The Greatest”, was one of boxing’s most popular fighters ever and was even named “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ali-chosen-centurys-greatest/">Sportsman of the Century</a>.” His fights received huge attention and were some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle">most watched sporting events of all time</a>, with numbers as high as one billion.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>8. UEFA Champions League &#8211; 380 Million Viewers</strong></span></h2>
<p>Soccer is the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html">most popular sport in the world</a> and the UEFA Champions League Final is one of its biggest events. The top teams in Europe battle all season to be one of two teams in this prestigious championship match. This year’s Champions League Final will play out in Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, providing travelers with the perfect reason to visit this popular travel destination.</p>
<p>The Champions League Final is consistently one of the world’s most watched sporting events.

Doha has been a wonderful destination to indulge in our passion for gastronomy and we love sharing our memorable dining experiences with our guests. Doha has no shortage of wonderful restaurants with more on the horizon. This flourishing city has a little bit of everything in terms of dining, including more than a few big names. We’ve enjoyed testing them out for you and have compiled a list of our favorites, which are detailed below.</p>
<h2>La Mar by Gaston Acurio</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lamar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" />223 Lusail Street<br />
<b>+974 4484 4919</b><br />doha.intercontinental.com/la-mar/</p>
<p>Acurio is a particularly celebrated chef who has helped to introduce Peruvian cuisine<br />
to the world. We’re big fans of La Mar’s location in Miami’s Mandarin Oriental and were excited to try the beachfront Doha eatery.Specialties include ceviches and tiraditos, which are delicious fresh fish dishes that incorporate various fresh fish with juices (usually citrus) and sauces. We also love their Lomo Saltado.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hakkasan</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hakkasan.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0170</b><br />hakkasan.com/doha </p>
<p>Another memorable meal was at Hakkasan, one of Doha’s hottest restaurants. With locations in London, NYC and Miami, it’s pretty famous. Hakkasan is known for having a great vibe and features Michelin star rated Cantonese and Asian fusion food within a nightclub feel. Located at the St. Regis, one of our 2022 World Cup properties, it’s wonderfully convenient for our guests of the property.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nobu</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nobu.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4494 8600</b><br />
www.fourseasons.com/doha/</p>
<p>As one of the most well-known restaurants in the world, we need not wax poetic about Nobu. What makes the Doha eatery a standout is its location at the end of a pier, providing guests with views over the water and back to the Corniche. It’s a pretty spectacular spot.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Astor Grill</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/astor.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4446 0000</b><br />
www.astorgrilldoha.com</p>
<p>If you asked us where to find a great steak in Doha, we’d send you to Astor Grill. Inspired by New York steakhouses, Astor Grill presents a modern version complete with incredible cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and an extensive wine list. Another St. Regis gem.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STK</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stk.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />West Bay Lagoon<br />
<b>+974 4484 8588</b><br />
www.stk-doha.com</p>
<p>Our Ritz-Carlton guests have some incredible restaurants on-site too and STK is one of them. The popular restaurant has about ten outposts worldwide and boasts a club-like atmosphere. It’s a buzzing place with a fun atmosphere and great steak.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toro Toro</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/torotoro-doha.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5101</b><br />
www.torotorodoha.com</p>
<p>Located close to the St. Regis and the Ritz, Toro Toro offers modern Mexican influenced cuisine by Richard Sandoval (foodies may know his name from La Lagune, Brisas at Mayakoba or another of his 30+ restaurants worldwide).</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nozomi</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/nozomi.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Marsa Malaz Kempinski, The Pearl<br />
<b>+974 4035 5089</b><br />
www.nozomi-doha.com</p>
<p>The multiple award winning Nozomi is consistently well rated and a local favorite. It’s<br />
a happening place that offers contemporary Japanese cuisine and spectacular water<br />
views.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spice Market</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/spice-market.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />Doha West Bay<br />
<b>+974 4453 5135</b><br />
www.spicemarketdoha.com</p>
<p>The concept is Southeast Asian Street Food in an upscale atmosphere and it definitely<br />
works. Spice Market was named Time Out Doha’s Restaurant of the Year in 2018 and<br />
Best Asian Restaurant in 2019. The menu is extensive and the only downside is not being<br />
able to sample it all.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IDAM</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/alain-ducasse.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" />The Corniche<br />
<b>+974 4422 4488</b><br />
www.mia.org.qa/en/visiting/idam</p>
<p>Located inside the stunning Museum of Islamic Art (MIA), IDAM is Alain Ducasse’s first<br />
restaurant in the Middle East. The menu is mostly French Mediterranean with Arabic<br />
influences. The décor, courtesy of Philippe Starck, provides a memorable backdrop<br />
to the wonderful food. The service and the views are also excellent. The museum is<br />
absolutely worth visiting too!</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doha clearly has some amazing restaurants and there&#8217;s a lot more to love about this incredible city.

This renowned event is the most famous tennis tournament in the world and for good reason. There’s no arguing the tennis is first-class, but the host city is pretty special too. London is the perfect international destination for us anglophones. It’s exotic but not intimidating and it’s brimming with incredible attractions, fantastic eateries, world-famous shopping, and charming neighborhoods to discover. We’ve spent plenty of time in <a href="https://go.skyetrips.com/guide/london-travel-guide">London</a> and wanted to share our favorite ways to experience this fascinating city.</p>
<p>Seeing all the big attractions is one way to tour the city, but we’ve discovered so many other ways to enjoy London. From simple ways to spend a few hours to quintessential British experiences, these are some of our favorite things to do when we’re in London.</p>
<h2>See a West End Show</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48280" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/west-end-show.jpeg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Right up there with Broadway in terms of prestige, the West End theatres feature some of the hottest shows in the world. There are few better ways to spend a London evening than a great dinner and a West End Show. Our personal concierges can help with suggestions, dinner reservations, and show tickets.</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Afternoon Tea</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48281" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/afternoontea.jpeg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Is there anything more quintessentially British than afternoon tea? We think not. Whether you’re a tea drinker or not, it really is quite an experience. Our favorite spot for this wonderful tradition is at the Palm Court in the iconic Ritz London. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sunday Roast at a Local Pub</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48282" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sundayroast.jpg 730w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Sunday roast is one of England&#8217;s most beloved traditions. You’ll find many different versions ranging from very casual at the neighborhood pub to trendy upscale gastropub offerings. Whichever route you choose, it’s likely to be one of your most memorable meals. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Explore a New Neighborhood</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods-300x199.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48283" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonneighborhoods.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you’re feeling adventurous, hop on the tube (an experience in itself) and head to one of London’s many interesting neighborhoods to do some exploring. Each neighborhood seems to have its own personality and you’re likely to discover new restaurants, shops, and gardens. Outside of London&#8217;s core which includes Mayfair, Westminster, the West End and Knightsbridge, some other sure bets include Chelsea, Richmond, Kensington and Bloomsbury. There are endless choices for exploring London’s unique neighborhoods. </p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Check out the Culture</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48284" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/londonmuseums.jpeg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There’s an endless list of museums and art galleries in London, many of which don’t charge an admission fee. The well-known National Gallery, Tate Britain, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery are amongst the most popular and frequently visited. In South Kensington, spend a drizzly day exploring the Natural History Museum, the Victoria &#038; Albert Museum and the Science Museum; they form an excellent collection within walking distance of each other. The Wallace Collection, Saatchi Gallery and Dulwich Picture Gallery are smaller, more hidden away gems.</p>

Monaco has long been a favorite destination of travelers in search of luxury and glamour. Its luxury hotels are among the finest in the world and we’ve hand-picked some of the best for our Monaco Grand Prix guests. We’ve been traveling to Monaco for many years and would love to help you find the perfect accommodations fit during the biggest event of the year. To help you get started, we’ve detailed some of our favorite Monaco properties below.</p>
<p>In this principality that is known for the finer things, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/">accommodations</a> are no exception. The hotels here are some of the most luxurious anywhere. Those who travel with us to the Monaco Grand Prix will have access to some of the best properties in the region. Our hotels are carefully chosen not only for their quality, but also for their prime location and impressive amenities. </p>
<p>One of the things that is great about our curated selection of properties is that our guests can choose their preferred hotel experience. From the formal and elegant Hotel Hermitage to the younger and more relaxed Le Meridien Beach Plaza, we feel it’s important to pick the location and type of accommodations that best fits your mood and style. Part of the decision is whether to stay at Casino Square, which during the Grand Prix is really quite busy, or to choose a little more space closer to Larvotto Beach. </p>
<p>For those that like to start the day with a walk or run, or want to stay a little outside the bottleneck that is Casino Square, our recommendation would be either the Le Meridien Beach Plaza or the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel. </p>
<h2>LE MERIDIEN BEACH PLAZA</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22838" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/banner-le-meridien.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Boasting an exclusive private beach, this modern resort hotel is a very nice hotel and a great value during the Grand Prix. <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#meridien">Le Meridien</a> has great views to the Mediterranean, is contemporary in design, relaxed and chic in its vibe, and it’s outside of the crush of Casino Square, perfect for an early morning run or a walk on the beach followed by a frothy cappuccino. The food options are good, but not great, though you have lots of great options within a few minutes walk of the hotel. The gym, indoor and outdoor pools, and beach are second to none in Monaco. The rooms are well designed and spacious by European standards. Beds are comfortable and the Malin &#038; Goetz bathroom amenities are a nice touch. </p>
<h2>MONTE CARLO BAY HOTEL </h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg" alt="monte carlo bay" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18134" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-1-2.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This luxury hotel was built on reclaimed land and was a welcome addition to the hotel scene in Monaco. Essentially next door to the Le Meridien, <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#monte">this property</a> also allows you a bit of breathing room during the Grand Prix. This lavishly designed hotel has a Vegas meets French Riviera feel with expensive gardens, a grand entrance, and extensive views of the sea. The swimming pool complex is happening and includes a sand bottomed pool, a giant glass panelled conservatory and a well equipped fitness facility with a plush spa and yoga classes. The rooms are spacious with bathrooms that boast separate shower and bath, with amenities from the hotel’s Cinq Mondes Spa. With an in-house Michelin starred restaurant, Blue Bay, you know they are committed to providing guests with culinary delights. A lagoon-facing terrace at L’Hippocampe and the comfortable Blue Gin Bar both make for a relaxing on-property snack or cocktail. </p>
<h2>HOTEL HERMITAGE</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5-10-300x200.jpg" alt="hotel hermitage" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18122" />One of the grande dames of the hotel scene in Monaco is the elegant <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#hermitage">Hotel Hermitage</a>. This Belle Epoque palace is tucked away behind the Hotel de Paris and is a favorite of those pretending to fly under the radar. This opulent 19th century palace has all the gold leaf and marble topped commodes you would expect, given the line of Lamborghinis and Bentleys “discreetly” parked out front. Service is courteous and competent, with female staff adorned with silk scarves and waistcoated bellboys. Guests can charge any Monte Carlo SBM facilities to their room including one of the most impressive thermal spas in Europe. Rooms feature Louis XV style furniture and wallpaper, bathrooms contain plenty of marble, and products are by the legendary Parisian perfume maker Francis Kurkdjian. The Michelin starred Vistamar may be “the” place for seafood in Monaco, though any of the hotel’s eateries come with plenty of prestige wines and vintage champagne, making sure you don’t forget you are staying in a palace. </p>
<h2>HOTEL METROPOLE</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg" alt="hotel metropole" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-18136" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/18-2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/auto-racing-packages/monaco-grand-prix/hotels/#metropole">The Metropole</a> manages to seamlessly bridge a number of themes and styles, making it the choice for rockstars and royalty alike. Behind the monumental Belle Epoque facade, this hotel perfectly delivers both classic elegance and a relaxed modern vibe. The bar and lounge are a 21st century take on a 19th century drawing room. There are books and tapestries bathed in light and space. Just up from the casino and off the Boulingrins Gardens, it could not be more central. And then there is the name dropping; from the Michelin-starred cuisine at Christophe Cussac’s Yoshi to Karl Lagerfeld’s creation, Odyssey, a pool and restaurant oasis available only to hotel and spa guests, this hotel has cachet to spare. The rooms combine period furniture, flowing fabrics, art and artifacts with contemporary sensitivity and comfort. You will feel like a royal noble, except that these rooms are too well thought out for that. They may be pricey, but live a weekend in them and you will swear it is completely worth it. </p>
<p><b>And, for a hidden gem and completely other experience&#8230; </b></p>
<h2>CAP ESTEL</h2>
<p> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg" alt="cap estel monaco" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47905" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bp-capestel-ch.410-013.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Set on a tiny peninsula just outside the borders of Monaco, this small, luxurious gated mansion is the perfect A-list hideaway. Only minutes from the glitz and excitement of the Grand Prix, it offers its guests the very best of discreet service and luxe surroundings. With only 28 rooms and suites across three buildings, each with expansive views of the sea, this lush property combines elegant design and decor with the latest in technology. Add the Michelin starred creations of chef Patrick Raingeard and you truly have the ultimate in discreet luxury and exceptional service. </p>

After many years of experience, we’ve nailed down our best pieces of advice for anyone attending.</p>
<h2>What to Wear</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat-300x157.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="157" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47790" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-Derby-Hat.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the highlights of Derby is dressing up in a fashionable dress, fancy heels and a great hat. Our best tip: bring a pair of flip-flops or ballet flats to change into later in the day. After a day of walking between the paddock, spectator seating and the refreshment areas, your feet will thank you.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Check out the Paddock Area</h2>
<p>This large, open space is a place to see and be seen, and visitors can get surprisingly close to the horses as they’re paraded through the paddock pre-race. It’s also a great location to photograph the spectacular hats and colorful outfits of the spectators.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-1024x292.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="292" class="alignright size-large wp-image-47788" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-1024x292.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-300x86.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area-768x219.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-paddock-area.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Celebrities</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-celebrities-272x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="280" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47797" />For those hoping for a celebrity sighting, check out the Derby Red Carpet at Churchill Downs’ Gate 10, where many celebrities will walk on their way up to their VIP seats. If you want to get even closer to the celebs, you may want to consider attending the Barnstable Brown Gala, the most exclusive event of the weekend. <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>VIP Seating Options</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience-300x191.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="191" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47800" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience-300x191.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kentucky-derby-vip-experience.jpeg 398w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Speaking of VIP seating, those seats aren’t just for celebrities. If you want the ultimate Derby experience, we can arrange for a spot for you in one of the premium viewing areas including Millionaires Row, the Turf Club, the Finish Line Suites Balcony, and the Stakes Room. If you simply want to make sure you have a covered seat to protect you from the elements, our team can advise on which sections will best suit your needs.</p>
<h2>Food and Drink</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep-300x155.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47789" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Louisville-Kentucky-derby-mintjulep.jpg 657w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />No visit to Louisville would be complete without two things: sipping a mint julep and having a hot brown: an open-faced sandwich with sliced turkey, bacon and mornay sauce. As far as we’re concerned, there’s no better place to try your first mint julep than at Churchill Downs during the Kentucky Derby. As for the Hot Brown, we suggest trying the original at the historic Brown Hotel, one of our luxury properties.</p>
<h2>Experience Thurby</h2>
<p>A popular event with locals, Thursday at Churchill Downs (aptly named Thurby) offers a different experience than Friday or Saturday. There are races of course but there are also musical performances and other entertainment acts. Thurby also provides guests with a great opportunity to explore Churchill Downs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="206" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/clubhouse_14-300x206.jpeg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/clubhouse_14-300x206.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/clubhouse_14-768x528.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/clubhouse_14.jpeg 990w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>A long-standing ritual of spring, the Masters has its own personality. Some of its traditions are well known, others not so much. Many of the questions we get from our <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/professional-golf-packages/masters/">Masters</a> guests are about how to get the most out of their visit, including how to navigate its celebrated customs and traditions. We’ve learned a lot from our many visits to Augusta and have compiled some information to help all of those who hope to experience this iconic tournament one day.</p>
<h2>The Merch</h2>
<p>Official Masters merchandise is only available at Augusta National during Masters week. The question isn’t whether you will buy something, it’s when and how much. No doubt you’ll have a long list of requests from friends and family but when to buy it all will require some careful planning. Buy it too early and you’ll be lugging it around with you all day. Buy it too late in the tournament and you’ll find little selection left. It’s a fine line and the struggle is real. Your brother-in-law and your friends at the club are counting on you.</p>
<h2>The Food</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg" alt="masters pimento cheese sandwich" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47603" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Most first time visitors are shocked at the food and drink prices at Augusta National. Not because they’re so high, because they are so wildly inexpensive. You’ll feel like you’re in a different era. Where else in the world of sport can you grab a beer and one of those famous pillowy soft pimento cheese sandwiches for just $5.50?</p>
<p style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Chairs</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg" alt="masters chairs" width="300" height="158" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47605" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/masters-chairs.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want to sit down somewhere other than the grandstands on Augusta National, you’ll want to purchase or bring along a chair (but you’ll need to make sure it’s collapsible and doesn’t have armrests – Augusta National is strict with their rules). We definitely recommend buying a Masters chair; few things are more fun than showing up at a summer event and nonchalantly putting down your green Masters-logoed chair. “Oh yeah, that’s right, I did go the Masters this year.” Spots are first come, first serve. Many patrons (as you’ve likely noticed on TV, Masters attendees are referred to as patrons, never fans) will claim their spot early in the day and come and go as they please. There’s no need to worry about someone taking your chair or spot, that’s simply unheard of at this event and one of the many joys of the Masters. If you plan to plant a chair on Sunday for the lucky golfer’s emotional walk up 18, you will need to be there very early. It’s coveted real estate on Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>As with anything related to the great game of golf, it is important to know the rules. Masters patrons are keen observers of the etiquette and rules of this well-heeled event. Don’t worry, before you go we’ll send you a complete list of items that you can and can’t bring with you, like no phones or cameras after the practice rounds conclude. So for now, politeness rules the day, decorum is the modus operandi, and make sure your golf outfit is properly matched. </p>
<h2>The Souvenir Photo</h2>
<p>You know how they say you can’t get a picture during the Masters? Well, that’s not entirely true. To be clear, we are not recommending flouting the very serious rule about cameras. Instead, as you are making your way towards the Par 3 Course, you will likely see a line forming near the first hole. This is the picture line. Right near Founders Circle the Club will take your picture with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background. After they have taken your picture, they will give you a small plastic card that will allow you to retrieve the picture online later. Apart from the time spent, it won’t cost you a thing. </p>
<h2>The Big Decision</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg" alt="augusta masters field" width="300" height="179" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47606" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-1024x612.jpeg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-768x459.jpeg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For many people the highlight of the tournament is watching the last few deciding holes on Sunday afternoon. The anticipation and excitement is there and the whole week often comes down to the back nine at Augusta. While most patrons want to stay to experience this live, it makes for a challenge to find a good spot to view the action from. In fact, many patrons will leave early and head to a hospitality venue or somewhere else where they can watch the action on TV to guarantee themselves a great view. Should you stay or should you go? It’s something you may want to think about before Sunday.</p>
<h2>The Hospitality</h2>
<p>To do hospitality or not do hospitality, that is the question. This is something that is very much personal preference and another unique aspect that makes Augusta special. Unlike any other golf event, there is no hospitality on the course at Augusta National. This has created a variety of offsite hospitality venues, each with their own strengths. Skyetrips partners with the most solid hospitality providers and we can match you with the most well suited option. </p>
<h2>The Extensions</h2>
<p>After a few days on a golf high, we know first hand how hard it is to head back to real life. Instead, many of our clients choose to extend their trip with a few extra days in Hilton Head, Savannah, or a number of other golf destinations in the area.</p>
<p>One of the great things about travelling with Skyetrips is our team of professional hosts comprised of international sporting event experts and local hosts. We at Skyetrips want to help set your expectations and do whatever we can to ensure that you are prepared for everything you may encounter in Augusta and to create the best possible experience for our Masters guests.</p>

There’s the soccer, of course, but that’s just the beginning. Qatar&#8217;s World Cup will be a true once-in-a-lifetime experience for those in attendance. The 2022 World Cup schedule could not be more convenient. The group stage treats fans to four matches a day, all within 46 miles of each other. Unlike past years, fans can base themselves in one hotel and experience multiple matches a day, or even follow their team, without ever checking out. It’s an ideal set-up for those who want to feast on the soccer at the highest level. Always a top sporting event, this year is sure to go down in history as one of the best ever.</p>
<p>All that said, it&#8217;s anticipated that there will be an extreme shortage of hotel accommodations for the tournament. Skyetrips is unique with an unparalleled selection of top Doha luxury hotels that we have been able to contract for the event.</p>
