You can be there on race day to see who takes the checkered flag by booking a customized sports travel trip through <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyetrips</a>.</p>
<p>As a race car fan, the likely place to start is with your itinerary is with the races. You can choose to attend the practice sessions on Friday, the qualifying sessions on Saturday, and the F1 circuit race on Sunday. If you choose all three race days, plan to arrive Thursday and leave Monday. Or, just attend race day, it&#8217;s entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Once you do decide on the dates to attend the United States Grand Prix 2014, then Skyetrips will book your flight be it economy, first class, or private jet. Transportation from your home to the airport, and airport to hotel will of course be arranged for you.<span id="more-19135"></span></p>
<p>Your Grand Prix experience wouldn&#8217;t be yours if you didn&#8217;t choose your seating too. Skyetrips has four incredible<a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> seating packages</a> for you to choose from. Each package of Sunday tickets corresponds to one of four grandstands, each of which is located at a strategic turn alongside the 3.4 mile Circuit of the Americas race track.</p>
<p>One of the spectators&#8217; favorite grandstands is located at the spectacular corner of Turn 1. To reach Turn 1 from the start, drivers accelerate up a 133 foot hill then must negotiate an immediate, and blind, left turn. It is a true thrill to watch.</p>
<p>Turn 1 is the spot for hard core enthusiasts because the turns can be so harrowing to watch and are second to none on the F1 circuit. Fortunately for you, Skyetrips&#8217; <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn 1 Hospitality Suite</a> overlooks that corner. You can enjoy drinks, food, and a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the race cars arriving all from the comfort of this private balcony.</p>
<p>With race day action at the United States Grand Prix 2014 planned, customize the rest of your trip by taking full advantage of Skyetrips&#8217; considerable knowledge of Austin-area events and nightlife, and concierge services.</p>
<p>Skyetrips will make reservations at your choice of <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/united-states-grand-prix-packages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end Austin hotels</a>, the W Hotel Austin or the Hyatt Place Austin Downtown. These award winning hotels are within walking distance of many nightlife attractions, but you also have the option of hiring a private car throughout your stay to drive you out in the evening, as well as to and from the race track.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t want to miss Roadtrips’ exclusive invitation to Austin&#8217;s hottest A-list United States Grand Prix 2014 parties on Friday night. Or, you can choose from a range of other Austin attractions. Skyetrips can book tee times at a local golf club, perhaps a spa treatment or two, or make recommendations for other events. Your hotel concierge services will be among the best in Austin and can act as expert guides to the best of Austin&#8217;s fine dining and life-music venues.</p>

Tension is high, every pitch counts, and the best players take their performance to the next level. Throughout <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/world-series-packages/">MLB World Series history</a>, there have been a few unforgettable moments that baseball fans will remember forever. Here are our favorites!</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">MLB World Series History Great Moments:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1988 – Kirk Gibson’s Game 1 Walk-Off Home Run</strong></span></h3>
<p>The injured Kirk Gibson was called upon to pinch hit for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 against the Oakland Athletics. The Athletics had legendary closer Dennis Eckersley on the mound. After multiple fouls, Eckersley delivered a backdoor slider that Gibson belted over the fence to win the game. This famous at-bat in MLB World Series history would be Gibson’s only plate appearance in this World Series, which Los Angeles won 4-1.<span id="more-19133"></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1986 – Bill Buckner’s Game 6 Error</strong></span></h3>
<p>Bill Buckner’s game-losing World Series error was a memorable one in MLB World Series history for the wrong reasons for Boston fans. Leading the series 3-2 against the New York Mets, the Red Sox had given up two runs to tie the game. Outfielder Mookie Wilson hit an easy grounder to Buckner at first. Buckner mangled it and the balled roll through his legs into right field, scoring the game-winning run easily. The Red Sox went on to lose Game 7; Buckner was a scapegoat for their series loss for many years afterwards.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1968 – Bob Gibson Sets The Single Game Strikeout Record</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 1968, two of the best pitchers in the game were set to open the World Series: Bob Gibson for the St. Louis Cardinals and Denny McLain for the Detroit Tigers. Gibson was dominant, striking out 17 batters in a five-hit shutout to set the record for most strikeouts in a single game in MLB World Series history, a record that still stands 46 years later.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1932 – Babe Ruth Calls His Home Run – Or Does He?</strong></span></h3>
<p>In the fifth inning of a heated Game 3 the famous Babe Ruth took the plate for the Yankees against Cubs pitcher Charlie Root. After exchanging lots of trash talk with the Cubs bench and taking strike one, the Bambino made a pointing gesture: some say he was calling his shot, pointing over the center field wall, while others maintain he was pointing at Root or the Cubs’ bench. Whatever the case, after a called strike two, Ruth blasted a 440 foot home run over center field. The Yankees went on to sweep the Cubs in four games, winning the World Series.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2009 – Godzilla Invades The Bronx</strong></span></h3>
<p>In his last game as a Yankee, Hideki Matsui, nicknamed Godzilla, played a huge role in the Yankees’ 27th World Series win. With a 3-2 lead against the Philadelphia Phillies, Matsui hit a two-run homer in the second inning to get New York on the board. After the Phillies scored a run in the top of the third, Matsui responded with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the inning. In the fifth inning, Matsui racked up another two RBIs with a double off J. A. Happ, helping the Yankees reach a 7-3 victory.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2001 – Luis Gonzalez Bests The Sandman</strong></span></h3>
<p>One of the few blights on the sterling career of the Yankees’ legendary closer Mariano Rivera is Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. With the game tied and the bases loaded, outfielder Luis Gonzalez hit a blooper over Derek Jeter’s head and scored the winning run, giving the Diamondbacks their first World Series title.</p>

Being one of the most watched F1 Grand Prix events in the world, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Canadian Grand Prix</a> (Grand Prix du Canada in French) has been a witness to many such moments. First held at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario in 1961, it has been a part of the Formula One World Championship since 1967. The race moved to its present location in Ile Notre-Dame, Montreal in 1978.</p>
<p>Here are 5 of the most memorable moments in Canadian Grand Prix history:<span id="more-19118"></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A bungled pace car interlude (1973)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: The 1973 Canadian Grand Prix was a rain-soaked event that produced unexpected results. On Lap 3, Austrian Niki Lauda driving a BRM took the lead from Ronnie Peterson, driving a Lotus. When Lauda stopped to change tires in the 20th lap, Jody Scheckter and Francois Cevert collided on Lap 33, creating a bungled pace car interlude that allowed Briton Jackie Oliver, American Peter Revson and Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise to take the lead. There was a lot of confusion for hours after the race, but eventually Revson was declared the winner.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Villeneuve&#8217;s amazing car control skill (1981)</span>:</strong> Quebec native Gilles Villeneuve created history in 1987 by becoming the only Canadian to win the Canadian Grand Prix. But in 1981, he demonstrated his amazing car control skill when the front wing of his Ferrari went askew after a crash &#8211; and he managed to drive on to third place in that condition! The race was won by Frenchman Jacques Laffite with Briton John Watson in second place.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A dramatic finale (1991)</span>:</strong> The finale of the 1991 race is considered to be one of the most dramatic in the history of the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Canadian Grand Prix</a>. Nigel Mansell was leading until the very last lap, and he was just a few corners from the finish line when his car failed him. He was quickly overtaken by Nelson Piquet driving a Benneton. This was Piquet&#8217;s 23rd and final Formula One victory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alesi&#8217;s popular win (1995)</span>:</strong> In the 1995 edition of the Grand Prix, Ferrari&#8217;s Jean Alesi took the lead when Michael Schumacher’s vehicle had electrical problems and Damon Hill’s car had a hydraulic failure. His win was voted the most popular race victory of the season, largely because it was the number 27 Ferrari that had once belonged to Gilles Villeneuve. It was also memorable for the fact that Schumacher gave Alesi a lift back to the pits after his car ran out of fuel. It was also the only grand prix win of Alesi&#8217;s racing career.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The longest F1 race in history (2011)</span>:</strong> When rainstorms delayed the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix for hours, it became the longest F1 race in history. But when the race started, Jenson Button zoomed from the last place, caught the German leader Sebastian Vettel, forcing him into making a mistake, and then drove to victory. Afterwards, Jenson described it as his best race ever making it a Canadian Grand Prix 2011 result to go down in history.</li>

Located in the north of England, the city of Liverpool sits on the River Mersey and is the fourth largest city in the country. Once an impressive port, Liverpool is also known for its friendly and hospitable residents and their fabulous sense of humor.</p>
<p>However, it was The Beatles that brought fame to the city of Liverpool. Here, you can see historic Beatles sites like Penny Lane, Strawberry Field, and take a Magical Mystery Tour. So, apart from its connection to this unique band, what are some of the other great attractions of Liverpool?</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>St. George’s Hall</b> &#8211; You can’t possibly visit Liverpool and not see St. George’s Hall with its gardens to the rear and plateau to the front. A neoclassical grade 1 building, St. George’s Hall is the number one Liverpool attraction and your trip to the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/british-open-packages/"><b>2014 British Open</b></a> is the perfect opportunity to walk around this lovely building. Take this chance to see the extraordinary organ built by Henry Willis and also the unique mosaic floor made from Minton tiles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Walker Art Collection</b> &#8211; A trip to Liverpool must include a visit to one of the biggest art collections outside of London, the Walker Art Collection. The collection began in 1819 with 37 paintings pertaining to the personal collection of William Roscoe, who was forced to sell them after his bank failed. The Walker Art Collection is an impressive blend of magnificent works by Rembrandt, Degas, as well as David Hockney, Lucien Freud, and Banksy.<span id="more-19095"></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Hope Street</b> &#8211; Few places have deserved more their name than Hope Street in Liverpool, featuring the Catholic Cathedral at one end and the Anglican Cathedral at the other. If you decide to let your passion for golf drive you to the 2014 British Open in Liverpool, make sure you take a stroll down Hope Street and listen to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra or visit the famous men toilets at the Philharmonic Pub.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Pier Head</b> &#8211; There is probably no other sight in Liverpool as astounding as the Pier Head, a World Heritage Site. You can visit the three world-famous graces, which are The Liver Building, the Cunard Building, and The Port of Liverpool Building, but you can also see the many exhibitions in the newly added Liverpool Museum.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Albert Dock</b> &#8211; A wonderfully renovated place, the Albert Dock is now a shopping parade with The Tate Liverpool and cozy restaurants. The home of the Maritime Museum, the Albert Dock is one of the most popular attractions in Liverpool and is used for the Tall Ships regatta. The area is also known for its diverse and active nightlife with fashionable restaurants and bars.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>Speke Hall</b> – While in town for the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/british-open-packages/"><b>2014 British Open</b></a> visit one of the oldest remaining buildings in Liverpool, which is Speke Hall. This historic site’s roots go back as far as the Tudors. During the reformation, a priest’s hole was used to hide members of the clergy. Don’t miss a meeting with the ghost of Mary Norris, who haunts the building remorseful about killing her young son.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><b>The Cavern Club</b> &#8211; A nightclub that was originally opened in 1957, the Cavern Club is known as the center of the music scene in the 1960s. The Beatles have placed The Cavern Club securely on the world map and you simply have to visit to this amazing piece of rock and roll history.</li>

The hustle and bustle in the New York and New Jersey area during <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Super Bowl week</a> is sure to be at an all-time high.  Not only will the sights, shops and subways be busy, the restaurants will be even busier than normal.</p>
<p>With hundreds of dining destinations in the New York area, it’s almost impossible to create a guide that will suit everyone. Places like the Russian Tea Room, 21 Club, Delmonico’s and Per Se offer some of New York’s most iconic dining experiences and if you can get a reservation, definitely worth a try. However, your Skyetrips Super Bowl package will expose you to a few other classics.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Dining</strong><br />
Every <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Super Bowl package</a> will include your choice of prime New York hotel, and every hotel option will also have its own dining options.  Whether it is the Setai Fifth Avenue, the Chatwal Hotel or the Ramada Plaza New Yorker, fine dining will be part of the equation.  Additionally, most of these hotels are within walking distance to some of New York’s best eateries.</p>
<p><strong>The Street</strong><br />
Let’s keep in mind that you’re going to be in New York, and New York is famous for its food trucks and street food. You can get everything from a simple hot dog or pizza slice to sushi to gourmet lobster rolls on the streets of New York, and everyone should give it a try at least once if they are in town.  Once you get in there and try some authentic New York street food, you might find that’s all you really want or need.</p>
<p><strong>The Game</strong><br />
Along with all the eating, remember that you’re in town for a football game.  Not just any football game, it’s the biggest football game on the NFL schedule!  You’ll get prime seats, game day transfers to and from the stadium, optional parties and other events, and you’ll be right there for the famous Super Bowl halftime show.</p>
<p>It’s anybody’s guess which two teams will be left standing when the 2014 Super Bowl arrives, but anyone who signs up for a <a href="/trip/super-bowl-packages/">Skyetrips Super Bowl package</a> can be sure that they’ll experience the best that New York and New Jersey have to offer.  Call or email to get started creating your 2014 Super Bowl travel package today.</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4100" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/us_open_tennis.jpg" alt="US Open Tennis" width="434" height="241" /><br />
<b>1)  Love that Home Cooking </b></p>
<p>Since the US Open was first held way back in 1881, an American has appeared in either the men’s or women’s singles final in every year but six.  Only six times!  And two of those six tournaments took place within the past few years.  The 2002 US Open saw the most American domination, as Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi in the men’s final and Serena Williams beat her sister Venus in the women’s.</p>
<p><b>2)  All Three Surfaces</b></p>
<p>The US Open is the only grand slam tennis tournament that’s been held on all three of the different playing surfaces used in professional tennis.  It has been held on both grass and clay at Forest Hills, and on hard court in its present location of Flushing Meadows.</p>
<p><b>3)  Lining Their Pockets</b></p>
<p>The US Open is the richest single sporting event, with the highest single prize.  Last year, the winners of both the men’s and women’s US Open each received almost $2 million in prize money.</p>
<p><b>4)  Play Stopped by Gunshots</b></p>
<p>In 1977 during a John McEnroe match, the play was delayed because of a shooting in the crowd.  One spectator had been hit in the leg by a stray bullet that came into the stadium off the street.  The play was delayed for a few minutes then resumed, and it wasn’t until the match was over that everyone found out what really happened.</p>
<p><b>5)  Sporting Neighbors</b></p>
<p>In 2009, the New York Mets moved from Shea Stadium to Citi Field, which is basically a stone’s throw away from Flushing Meadows.  It really is possible to catch a tennis match and a ball game all in the same day.</p>
<p><b>6)  All Hail the Lefty</b></p>
<p>Lefties only comprise about 10 percent of the world’s population, but between 1974 and 1984 every single male US Open champ was left-handed.  That’s a lot of lefties!  On the women’s side, there weren’t any between 1902 and 1982 until Martina Navratilova ended the streak.</p>
<p><b>7)  The Benefit of Being #1</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, it pays to be number one, and this is especially true if you’re in the men’s <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/8-best-major-tennis-tournaments/">US Open tennis tournament</a>.  From 1977 until 2009, every men’s champion was either the current world-ranked number one player or had been in the past.</p>
<p>Want to be part of history at this year&#8217;s US Open in New York? Skyetrips can help you get there with your choice of match tickets. We&#8217;ll put together a custom <a href="/trip/us-open-tennis-packages/">US Open travel package</a> so you can experience the best in professional tennis. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> for more information about customizing your experience.</p>

Ask any serious hockey fan what it means to them and he or she will probably tell you that they&#8217;d give anything to watch the finals. First commissioned in 1892, the Stanley Cup went through several transformations before being officially adopted by the NHL. In its glorious century old history, the finals have produced a number of great players and memorable moments that will stay at the forefront of generations to come.</p>
<p>Really great moments in sporting events do not come every day. They are not made, but happen spontaneously and leave a lasting impression on a spectator&#8217;s mind. And they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Without further delay, here are Skyetrips&#8217; 5 absolutely NHL greatest moments in Stanley Cup history:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bobby Orr scores an iconic goal and flies into the air</span>: One of the most iconic moments in the history of NHL is the winning goal by Boston Bruins defenseman Bobby Orr, one of the greatest NHL players of all time, against the St. Louis Blues in 1970. Immediately after scoring the goal, he was tripped. The moment he flew into the air to celebrate his goal was captured for posterity by TV cameras and will be an inspiration for both players and fans for years to come.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patrick Kane scores a goal and nobody knows it</span>: Considered rather anti-climactic at the time because nobody even saw it, Patrick Kane&#8217;s winning goal for the Chicago Blackhawks against the Philadelphia Flyers in the final of 2010 has got to be one of the greatest Stanley Cup moments.  After getting possession of the puck during overtime, he took a shot from an impossible angle and made a perfect score. But as he threw off his gloves in a fit of joy, he was greeted with stunned silence because nobody had seen him score. This is one goal that will never be forgotten!</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brett Hull&#8217;s controversial goal against the Buffalo Sabres</span>: Probably the most controversial call in NHL&#8217;s history happened in 1999 when Brett Hull of the Dallas Stars scored a winning goal against the Buffalo Sabres. Players weren&#8217;t allowed to be in the goal crease before the puck at the time, the only exception given to the player who was in possession of the puck. The Sabres refused to accept the goal as similar goals had been disallowed throughout the season. But the referee allowed it and the goal stood. Despite the controversy, it was a great moment for Hull and his team.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mario Lemieux scores the perfect goal</span>: One of the most dazzling goals in the history of NHL was made by Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins against the Minnesota North Stars in 1991. In the second period of game two, he went coast to coast, smoothly sailing past the Minnesota defense and goaltender and then made a great goal. It is considered by hockey buffs to be one of the greatest goals in NHL history.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark Messier keeps his word</span>: A day before game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, Mark Messier, the captain of the New York Rangers, announced to the New York press that his team would win the next game against the New Jersey Devils. At the time, the Rangers were the underdogs and nobody believed him. The following evening, he scored a hat trick, leading his team to victory in the game, and throughout the playoffs where they eventually won the coveted Stanley Cup. What he did that day remains as one of the most remarkable moments in the history of NHL.</li>

You should use this opportunity to see and experience the city of Montreal, the cultural capital of Canada. Since your calendar will be packed for three days from the 7<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> of June when the races take place, you should plan a holiday of at least five days so that you will have enough time to visit the beautiful city of <a title="2014 Canadian Grand Prix Packages" href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Montreal</a>.</p>
<p>The second largest city in Canada (after Toronto) and the second largest French-speaking urban center in the world (after Paris), Montreal is one of the top tourist destinations in Canada. This historic city was first settled by European immigrants about 400 years ago, but Native American settlements in the area date back to prehistoric times.</p>
<p>Montreal has many places of historic significance that attract visitors from far and wide every year. Your <a title="2014 Canadian Grand Prix Packages" href="https://www.skyetrips.com/trip/canadian-grand-prix-packages/">Montreal Grand Prix</a> getaway will not be complete without visiting at least some of the following 7 places.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.10best.com/destinations/canada/montreal/montreal/attractions/vieux-montreal/">Vieux Montréal</a>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vieux-montreal.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5192" alt="vieux-montreal" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vieux-montreal-250x166.jpg" width="250" height="166" /></a><br />
This is the historic part of the city and its cobblestone streets and colonial style buildings date back to 1642. The center of the old city is Place Jacques-Cartier, which is famous for restaurants, boutiques and clubs housed in 17<sup>th</sup> century buildings. Something is always happening here and at times you may even be swamped by fellow tourists, but it’s a great place to be any time.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vieux-Port</span>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vieux-port.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5193" alt="vieux-port" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/vieux-port-250x163.jpg" width="250" height="163" /></a><br />
Dating back more than 350 years, the Vieux-Port was once Old Montreal&#8217;s gateway to the St. Lawrence River and the hub of shipping. It is now a top tourist destination where you can enjoy walking, biking, ice-skating and shopping.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">McGill University</span>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mcgill.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5194" alt="mcgill" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mcgill-250x256.jpg" width="250" height="256" /></a><br />
Founded by a wealthy Scottish immigrant by the name of James McGill in 1813, McGill University is Montreal&#8217;s signature university. A tour of the university, which lasts about an hour and is led by students, takes you to the major buildings and facilities in both the original downtown and the Macdonald Campus.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Musée du Château Ramezay</span>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chateau-ramezay.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5195" alt="chateau-ramezay" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chateau-ramezay-250x166.jpg" width="250" height="166" /></a><br />
Built in 1705, the Château Ramezay is one of the oldest buildings in North America. But it also owes it fame to Benjamin Franklin who tried to persuade Montreal to join the United States from here. It is now a famous history museum where artifacts from the 18th and 19th century are permanently displayed and a re-enactment of the 18th century life is performed live by actors.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basilique Notre-Dame</span>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basilique-notre-dame.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5196" alt="basilique-notre-dame" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basilique-notre-dame-250x164.jpg" width="250" height="164" /></a><br />
Designed by the architect James O&#8217;Donnell, this neo-Gothic church styled after the great churches of Europe was built in 1829. It is famous for its fine woodwork, blue vaulted ceilings, rose ceiling windows and a massive church bell. There is also a museum that has religious artifacts and paintings on permanent display.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapelle Notre-Dame-De-Bon-Secours</span>:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chapelle-notre-dame.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5197" alt="chapelle-notre-dame" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chapelle-notre-dame-250x351.jpg" width="250" height="351" /></a><br />
This small chapel built by Marguerite Bourgeoys, the founder of the Notre Dame congregation of nuns, to provide refuge to weary sailors. Dating back to 1857, it is the oldest church in Montreal. It also houses the Marguerite Bourgeoys Museum, which has historical and archaeological artifacts on permanent display.</li>
</ol>
