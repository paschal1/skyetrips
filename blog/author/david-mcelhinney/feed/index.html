While this is great for anyone visiting Tokyo for the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/">2020 Summer Games</a> (taking place in 2021), it also means you’re best setting out a roadmap for the areas you most want to visit.</p>
<p>Unlike many cities around the world, you can’t just head for Tokyo’s “city center” for a quick reconnaissance to get your bearings. For one, plenty of neighborhoods could stake a claim to being the beating heart of the capital. Furthermore, if you head to the literal center &#8212; the Imperial Palace &#8212; you may end up wondering what happened to all the gleaming skyscrapers and neon lights that have so embodied Tokyo in pop culture over the years.</p>
<p>In light of this, figuring out where to spend your time may seem like a Herculean task. But don’t worry, we have done the hard part for you. Split between the two Summer Games venue areas &#8211; the Heritage Zone &amp; Tokyo Bay Zone &#8211; check out our breakdown of the top neighborhoods in Tokyo, along with the top attractions, experiences, restaurants and bars within them.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Bay Zone</h3>
<p>With emphasis on gymnastics, indoor events and watersports, here is the full list of <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/venues/">Tokyo Bay Zone venues and arenas</a>.</p>
<h2>Odaiba</h2>
<p>Odaiba, located in the futuristic Tokyo Bay area, is defined by its neo-modern architecture, immersive 3D art exhibits, and romantic pleasure boat cruises. Odaiba offers a glimpse into the future; a vision of the city Tokyo is striving to become: a high-tech, entertainment and cosmopolitan hub representative of its place among the world’s greatest metropolises.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to experience Odaiba is via a yakatabune (pleasure boat) tour, which often includes all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink services. A pastime formerly reserved for the imperial aristocratic classes, yakatabune now carry visitors of all stripes around the waters of Tokyo Bay, passing some of Odaiba’s most iconic landmarks in the process, including the Fuji TV building and the color-dappled Rainbow Bridge. From the yakatabune’s deck, you can also see Tokyo’s two tallest structures, Tokyo Skytree and Tokyo Tower, illuminating the night skyline.</p>
<p>On land, there is also plenty of fun to be had in Odaiba. Digital art collective teamLab have collaborated on various art projects around Tokyo; their Odiaba-based Borderless exhibition is among the most popular, where immersive 3D installations and interactive environments are designed to erode the border between the art and its viewers. Though not technically in Odaiba, Toyosu Market is just a stone’s throw away. The world’s largest fish market moved from its former location in Tsukiji in 2018 and is a culinary treasure trove of fresh sushi and sashimi.</p>
<p>For family fun in Odaiba, check out Joypolis, an amusement park and arcade based on IP from legendary video game company Sega, and the Gundam Statue inspired by the anime franchise of the same name.</p>

<h2>Shibuya</h2>
<div style="float: right; margin: 10px; text-align: center;">
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-47115 size-medium" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-225x300.jpg" alt="Shibuya Crossing" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shibuya-Crossing-1-scaled.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Shibuya Crossing</span></p>
</div>
<p>Of all Tokyo’s neighborhoods, Shibuya may well be the most iconic. Its number one attraction is the world’s busiest &#8212; and possibly most Instagram’d &#8212; intersection, Shibuya Crossing. Thousands of pedestrians approaching from all angles duck and weave routes to the opposite side as the traffic signal changes; this happens like clockwork from daybreak until the last trains depart around midnight. This unique urban marvel has contributed to the soaring popularity of “vantage point” seats in the Tsutaya bookstore’s Starbucks overlooking the intersection.</p>
<p>Shibuya Crossing connects the Hachiko Memorial Statue &#8212; depicting the eponymous dog who used to meet his owner at Shibuya Station at the same time everyday; a tradition Hachiko continued even after his owner’s death &#8212; with Centergai, a lively retail and bar street running through the heart of central Shibuya.</p>
<p>Another reason why Shibuya is among the best Tokyo neighborhoods to visit is Nonbei Yokocho, or “Drunkards Alley”, a couple minutes from Shibuya Station’s Hachiko Exit. This pair of lamplit street corridors are lined by miniscule and specialist bars, from homemade peppered gin and tonics in TIGHT (an indication of the establishment’s size) to vogue natural wines in Wine Stand Bouteille.</p>
<p>Though, aesthetically speaking, Shibuya is dominated by a towering skyline and interweaving elevated walkways, it’s also home to Yoyogi Koen, one of the prettiest parks in the city. Meiji Jingu, a shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, sits in the midst of Yoyogi, guarded by a forest of over 100,000 trees which belies its downtown Tokyo location.</p>

<h2>Shinjuku</h2>
<div style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 10px; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-47004" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-300x225.jpg" alt="Shinjuku Food Palours" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shinjuku-Food-Choices-scaled.jpg 1417w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Shinjuku Food Palours</div>
<p>Alongside Shibuya, Shinjuku is arguably the most popular Tokyo neighborhood to visit. A center of retail, commerce and entertainment, it also represents the many faces of Tokyo, from its Hanazono-jinja and Shinjuku Junisu Kumano shrines to the labyrinthine Showa-Period (1926 &#8211; 1989) bars of Goldengai to the kitschy Robot Restaurant.</p>
<p>One of the main attractions in Shinjuku is the Godzilla statue, crawling over a skyscraper in Kabukicho, which periodically roars over the din of pachinko parlors, arcades, shops, peddlers and pedestrians filling the air with a cacophony of inner-city sound.</p>
<p>Shinjuku’s neon-lit caverns are <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/coolest-restaurants-places-to-eat-tokyo/">packed full of restaurants</a>, including Hanbey, a wartime izakaya (gastropub) serving cheap and delicious sharing plates, and the Robot Restaurant which frankly is more about the spectacle than its uninspired food. For drinks in Shinjuku, Golden Gai is not to be missed; it covers an area approximating the size of a football field, in which you can find around 250 themed bars.</p>
<p>For cultural offerings in Shinjuku, you can take a stroll through the well-kempt lawns and flower patches of Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, visit one of the aforementioned Shinto shrines, or make a stop at the Yayoi Kusama Museum which celebrates the work of Japan’s foremost pop art trailblazer.</p>
<p>Shinjuku is also one of the best neighborhoods to stay in Tokyo; you can find our <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/best-places-to-stay-in-tokyo-for-the-2020-summer-games/">accommodation recommendations here</a>.</p>

<h2>Roppongi</h2>
<p>Roppongi is dripping with class; the Tokyo neighborhood where glamorous shopping malls and outdoor art centerpieces rub shoulders with a handful of Japan’s finest museums. In the background, casting its regal gaze upon the surrounding area, is the fiery spire of Tokyo Tower.</p>
<p>Standing at 333 meters, Tokyo Tower is the second highest man-made structure in the city, symbolizing the prosperity of post-war Japan. You can head up to the 150-meter observation deck via an elevator or a lung-busting staircase of 600 steps.</p>
<p>Of Roppongi’s museum collection, the Mori Art Museum is the most popular. A creative showcase for 21st-century Tokyo, the Mori Art Museum plays a central role in the celebration of contemporary art and architecture in Japan. The museum sits atop the Roppongi Hills commercial, dining and entertainment complex where you can also admire the 30-meter-tall Maman Spider Sculpture by Louis Bourgeois.</p>
<p>A ten-minute walk from the Mori Art Museum is the National Art Center, Tokyo, famed for its rippling glass facade and for hosting one of the largest exhibition spaces in the country. For classic Japanese antiques, head to the Suntory Museum of Art, in the Tokyo Midtown complex.</p>

<h2>Tokyo Station and Imperial Palace Area</h2>
<p>Tokyo Station, rather being a mere railway terminus, is often considered an area in its own right. It’s located a short stroll from the Imperial Palace, where the sitting Emperor of Japan still resides. What makes the Tokyo Station area one of the best neighborhoods in Tokyo to visit, is its diverse range of attractions.</p>
<p>At Tokyo Station, apart from being able to catch Shinkansen (bullet trains) to every corner of the Japanese archipelago, you can also indulge in some retail and culinary therapy. The basement-floor Ichibangai mall is home to Tokyo Character Street, a concourse of anime and manga (comic book) merchandise stores. On the ground floor, you’ll find Tokyo Me+, a sugary emporium of omiyage (Japanese souvenirs, often sweets). Tokyo’s largest ramen alley, packed with eight individual shops serving differing styles of ramen, is also situated in Tokyo Station.</p>
<p>If you’re in the Tokyo Station neighborhood, you should pay a visit to the Tokyo Imperial Palace East Gardens on the former site of Edo Castle (home of Japan’s militaristic dictators until 1868). Though access to the main section of the palace grounds is prohibited &#8212; it is technically a private residence &#8212; it provides a nice afternoon stroll over a carp-filled moat and past ancient castle foundations.</p>

<h2>Ginza</h2>
<div style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 10px; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-47011" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-300x240.jpg" alt="Chuo-dori Street Ginza" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chuo-dori-Street-Ginza-1-scaled.jpg 1329w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Chuo-dori Street Ginza</div>
<p>Tokyo’s Ginza neighborhood is the Japanese capital at its most ostentatious. It’s bisected by main shopping artery Chuo-dori and marked by impressive architecture such as the neoclassical Wako building; the rusted, LEGO-like facade of Nakagin Capsule Tower; and the gravity-defying V8 building.</p>
<p>Chuo-dori is lined with stores sporting the highest of high fashion brands, from Bulgari to Prada, along with boutique shopping malls, including Ginza Six and Matsuya Ginza. On weekends Chuo-dori prohibits automotive traffic, meaning pedestrians take to the lanes in the middle of the road for a picture-perfect and luxurious amble.</p>
<p>By night, Ginza’s bars are the gold standard in Japanese cocktail mixology, with 300-plus watering holes hidden in every nook and cranny of the central Tokyo neighborhood. Bar Orchard, which specializes in fresh fruit cocktails served in elaborate receptacles, and the accolade-showered Gaslight Eve, are among the best.</p>
<p>Though the world’s greatest fish market moved from Tsukiji to Toyosu in 2018, the old Tsukiji Outer Market is still open for business next door to Ginza. Simply put it’s one of the best places on the planet to eat raw fish. For another distinctly Japanese experience, catch a kabuki play at the Kabuki-za Theatre in Ginza (tablets providing translation of the performances are available).</p>

The Japanese capital’s electric cityscape, UNESCO-recognized culinary heritage, quirky subcultures, and rags-to-riches history put it atop many Americans’ travel bucket lists &#8212; a trend expected to continue.</p>
<p>During this meteoric rise, Japanese cultural differences from the western world have reached a point of cliché: the unfailing punctuality of the Japanese people, the efficiency of the transport network, the politeness of the locals and their inference on customer service, or how restaurants and bars – when you can finally locate them – exist on a charmingly miniature scale.</p>
<p>But there is a reason such clichés exist. Japan was closed off to the rest of the world for over 200 years from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> centuries – known as the Sakoku Period – during which time the nation simmered exclusively in its own culture, free from the hands of outside influence. As such, Japanese cultural norms developed in a singular fashion, much of which is still apparent today.</p>
<p>When comparing Japanese culture vs American culture, the primary differences stem from the diametrically opposed foundations upon which Japanese and the US society were built: collectivism vs individualism. This is the root cause of the cultural differences you’ll need to consider when visiting Japan on your travels.</p>
<h3>Always Carry Cash</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46599 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cash.jpg" alt="tokyo cash payment" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cash.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cash-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Japan may love robots, electronic toilets, and neon-flanked highways, but its high-tech image is, frankly, a bit of a misnomer. At the level of general business infrastructure – which includes cashless payment systems – Japan is actually lagging quite far behind the US and the rest of the developed world.</p>
<p>As such, it’s recommended to have cash, always. Some bank ATMs will support foreign credit/debit cards, usually indicated by a sign above the machine. While almost all convenience stores, which are as a rule open 24/7, will have ATMs, and these should work with all foreign credit/debit cards.</p>
<p>Hotels, classy restaurants, and big chain stores will usually accept card payment methods, but at street level, especially in the independent brick and mortars, cash reigns supreme.</p>
<h3>Smoking Laws are Confusing</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46600 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/smoking.jpg" alt="smoking in japan vs american culture" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/smoking.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/smoking-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />One of the most bizarre cultural differences between the US and Japan are the laws around smoking. Restrictions on smoking indoors were recently implemented in Tokyo with a view to the since-postponed 2020 Summer Games (rescheduled for July 2021).</p>
<p>However, in smaller bars and restaurants in the capital it’s not uncommon to wine and dine in the company of plumes of tobacco smoke &#8212; and beyond the prefectural borders of greater Tokyo, you’ll find yet more smoke-friendly restaurants.</p>
<p>Contrary to the United States, smoking outside is also a social faux pas, if not outright forbidden as it is on the streets of Japan’s major urban areas. Rather, you’ll see – or smell – designated smoking areas which sit on street corners as open-air booths. Alternatively, smokers may be directed to small ventilated rooms within restaurants or deep within the bowels of buildings.</p>
<h3>Where Are All the Trash Cans?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46608 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/trash-cans.jpg" alt="trash cans in japan stand out for tourists visiting" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/trash-cans.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/trash-cans-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IE">Japanese trash cans are great… when you can find them, that is. Drift by tourists on the streets of Tokyo and you’ll soon hear one of the most commonly voiced chagrins: “How are these streets so clean, yet I can never <a href="https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-tokyo/in-shibuya/article-a0002380/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">find a trash can</a>?” Though public trash cans have slowly begun to appear, their scarcity is still apparent.</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-IE">In Japan, it is typical to sort your own trash – of which you’ll often gather a lot thanks to the surplus of convenience stores and vending machines – before bringing it home to deposit in the correct waste bins. Nowadays, in certain train stations and most convenience stores, you’ll find trash cans marked with Japanese script and an accompanying picture indicating what goes inside: PET bottles, cans, glass, burnable waste, etc. </span></p>
<h3>ALWAYS Carry Your Passport</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-46607" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/passport.jpg" alt="passports in tokyo japan" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/passport.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/passport-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />One of the cultural similarities between the US and Japan, though it’s only effected upon visitors, is the mandate that all legal aliens must carry a passport on them at all times. This may seem a little austere, and is no joy for the traveler who tends to leave things astray, but it is a rule and the local police are permitted to detain any who breach it.</p>
<p>The Japanese police are not guaranteed to speak English to any degree of competence, meaning the process for engineering your exit back out of the precinct will likely be long and laborious. Additionally, during global events, Japanese police tend to patrol in greater numbers and are known for carrying out random ID checks.</p>
<p>So just to reiterate: Carry your passport.</p>
<h3>Observe Train Etiquette</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-46606" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tokyo-trains.jpg" alt="train etiquette in japan" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tokyo-trains.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tokyo-trains-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Train etiquette is one of the most obvious examples of the differences in western individualism and Japanese collectivism. In Japan, people tend to avoid acting in any way that may be deemed insensitive, offensive, egregious, or even mildly off-putting to those around them. Japanese people tend to focus on maintaining the <em>‘wa’ </em>– the collective harmony; the social order.</p>
<p>What this means in practice – on trains at least – is carriages crammed full of people which lull along the tracks in almost complete silence. To help maintain this atmosphere of <em>‘wa’ </em>when using Japan’s public transport system: refrain from eating, drinking, talking loudly, sneezing, and be sure to turn your phone on silent; basically, do as the Japanese do.</p>
<h3>Don’t Fret Over Tipping</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46605 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tipping.jpg" alt="tipping in tokyo difference between USA" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tipping.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tipping-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />There is a rare story one hears in Japan, usually whispered in hushed tones by someone who’s been privy to that most unusual of scenarios: the Japanese waiter who accepts a tip. Though it would be disingenuous to say this never happens, your chances of spotting a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow are approximately as high.</p>
<p>If you simply cannot resist the urge to tip, expect to get chased down the road with a handful of yen coins rather than the recipient staff bowing graciously as they accept your generous imbursement. This is arguably the biggest difference in Japanese and US social etiquette. But don’t let it concern you, Japanese restaurant and bar staff are typically well compensated by their employers, and view tipping as unnecessary rather than downright rude.</p>
<h3>Communication Can Be Indirect</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46604 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/communication.jpg" alt="communication in japan" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/communication.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/communication-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Mastering the dark arts of Japanese communication has baffled foreigners since they first began to arrive en masse in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. This is largely due to Japan’s indirect methods of communication and even their body language – a holdover from the days of the samurai when maintaining peace was priority number one – which stands in stark contrast to the more up-front and personal style of communication in the west.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the <em>gaijin </em>(foreigners) who find it confounding. When Emperor Hirohito broadcast live Japan’s surrender in WWII, he used such an archaic and indirect form of the language that many weren’t entirely sure of what he was saying.</p>
<p>In any case, when you get a response to a question along the lines of “it might be difficult” or “I’ll think about it”, this is often shorthand for no. Or maybe it’s not. You may have to read between the lines.</p>
<h3>Punctuality is Key</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-46603" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/time.jpg" alt="punctuality in japan time" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/time.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/time-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Japanese people, particularly within Japanese business culture, see punctuality not as a mere sign of respect, but an unequivocal virtue – to the extent they’ll sometimes arrive for meetings precisely at the agreed upon time, not a minute early or late. So, just bear in mind, showing up when you please in Japan may be considered more disrespectful than in other parts of the world. This is not to say all Americans forego timekeeping, but rather to reinforce the point: the Japanese take punctuality very, very seriously.</p>
<p>Case in point: trains in Japan are almost always on time. Ultimately there is still a margin for human error, such as the story which made international headlines in 2017 when the Tsukuba Express Line management apologized profusely for a train that departed 20 seconds ahead of schedule. Few train networks in the world however, could claim to be quite as efficient or punctual as the Japanese system.</p>
<h3>Omotenashi – The Art of Customer Service</h3>
<p><em><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-46602 size-full" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hospitality.jpg" alt="Omotenashi hospitality in Japan" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hospitality.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hospitality-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />Omotenashi </em>is one of Japan’s many untranslatable terms. But generally, it’s ascribed to the country’s famed customer service; something hinged upon rigorous protocol which has been tuned over the centuries into a fine art. It’s another component of Japanese culture which is, in its own way, singular &#8212; and it is apparent everywhere.</p>
<p>Think it of <em>omotenashi</em> as predicting the customer&#8217;s needs before he/she knows what said needs are: hot towels in winter or cold towels in summer on arrival at a restaurant, store clerks who greet shoppers with the most courteous Japanese phrases (known as <em>“keigo” </em>– respectful language) and deep bows, or slippers to use in the bathroom when you’re in a no-shoes establishment. <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/au/experience/culture/omotenashi/"><em>Omotenashi</em></a> focuses on the little things, which often make all the difference.</p>
<h3>Toilets of the Future</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-46601" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/japanese-toilet.jpg" alt="japanese toilet" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/japanese-toilet.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/japanese-toilet-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />At first, Japanese toilets can seem wildly complicated and may come as a culture shock. Many foreigners, more familiar with the standard chain or lever system, find the control panels with flashing buttons overwhelming. However, most buttons come with <em>fairly</em> explanatory photos, and if in doubt, look out for “大” (big flush) and “小” (little flush). Also feel free to fiddle around with the controls – there is no ejector seat button.</p>
<p>Once you become well-acquainted with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sUKYAoUaG4">electronic Japanese toilet</a> and its jets of water, in-built nature soundscapes, and multiple flushing options, returning to your old model may fill you with melancholy. But you take solace in the fact that you’re not alone.</p>
