<p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: right; font-weight: bold;"><em>Sam Buffie, Skyetrips&#8217; Lead Event Planner</em></p>

<p><em>Roadtrips’ Lead Event Planner, Sam Buffie, recently spent a week in Tokyo in preparation for the 2020 Summer Games. She scouted out accommodations, interviewed local partners, and spent some time checking out the neighborhoods and the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/things-to-do-in-tokyo-during-the-2020-summer-games/">best things to do in Tokyo</a> &#8211; all to make sure we provide our clients with the very best of Tokyo. As one of our most experienced event hosts and a lifelong traveller, she’s seen more than her share of travel destinations and Tokyo was definitely a highlight. In our last blog, Sam provided some helpful tips on the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/best-places-to-stay-in-tokyo-for-the-2020-summer-games/">best places to stay in Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Games</a>. In our latest blog below, Sam discusses her most memorable experiences involving Tokyo’s incredible food and drink scene.</em></p>
<p>Like many of you, one of my favorite parts about traveling is sampling the local cuisine. What&#8217;s better than unfamiliar but excellent dining experiences to give one a taste, pun intended, of a new culture? Fortunately, <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/luxury-travel-guides/summer-games-ultimate-guide/">Tokyo is one of the best places in the world</a> to do this. It boasts everything from ramen joints to <a href="https://gm.gnavi.co.jp/restaurant/list/tokyo/">Michelin starred eateries</a> (well over 200 of them, more than any other city in the world). Anywhere you find yourself dining, you’ll notice that the Japanese have an obsession with perfect ingredients and it shows. There were a lot of highlights, just a few of which I’ve detailed below.</p>
<h2>7 of the Coolest Restaurants in Tokyo</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1">Misono Shinuku</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Yakitori joints</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Ginza Kappou Ukai</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Hyatt Centric</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Golden Gai</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Robot Restaurant</a></li>
<li><a href="#7">Tsukiji Market</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1">1. Misono Shinjuku</h3>
<p>One of the most memorable meals I had was at <a href="https://misono.org/en/shop/shinjuku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misono Shinjuku</a>. I knew I wanted to experience a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teppanyaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teppanyaki meal</a> in Japan and Misono seemed to be the perfect place to do this. Misono is believed to be the originator of Teppanyaki cuisine, which dates back to the mid-1940s. Misono Shinjuku is located on the 51st floor of an office tower and the first thing I noticed were the stunning views. I marveled as the skilled chefs prepared top grade Wagyu beef in front of me, and I couldn’t wait to try it. I wasn’t disappointed. It was the most incredible, melt-in-your-mouth beef I have ever tasted. The preparation, the presentation, the taste: it was perfection.</p>
<h3 id="2">2. Yakitori Joints</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-31135" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wagyu.jpg" alt="wagyu beef tokyo" width="300" height="410" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wagyu.jpg 300w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wagyu-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Another evening, I headed out to find myself some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitori" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yakitori</a>. I wandered down a dive strip of yakitori joints literally under the train tracks and stopped at one of the slightly larger ones, packed with the patrons. With a large mug of cold beer in hand, I sampled a whole variety of these grilled skewers, from straight up beef and chicken to the more exotic, intestinal yakitori. It was a loud environment with conversations and tables jammed close to one another. But the quality of the grilling and meat was great, the beer was cold, and the experience felt very authentic.</p>
<h3 id="3">3. Ginza Kappou Ukai</h3>
<p>Dinner at <a href="https://www.ukai.co.jp/english/ginzakappou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginza Kappou Ukai </a>was also superb. The restaurant, in the heart of Ginza, was beautiful, classy and quiet, with ample space between tables of elegantly dressed Japanese couples and small groups. Our chef showed great skill as he expertly and artistically made the food in front of us. Our seven course dinner was exquisitely prepared, wonderfully delicious, paired with great wine, and very expensive &#8211; but worth it.</p>
<h3 id="4">4. Hyatt Centric</h3>
<p>There were lots of great dinners but the lunches were remarkable too. While visiting the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/japan/hyatt-centric-ginza-tokyo/tyoct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyatt Centric</a>, one of our <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/">2020 Summer Games Hotels</a>, I had lunch onsite at their <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/japan/hyatt-centric-ginza-tokyo/tyoct/dining" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namiki667</a>. The attention to detail was evident from the flavor to the presentation to the service. And just when I thought I couldn’t eat another bite, they brought out a Valrhona chocolate tart that was heavenly.</p>
<h3 id="5">5. Golden Gai</h3>
<p>Another neat experience was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Golden_Gai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Gai</a>. In a city that’s known for bright lights and towering skyscrapers, Golden Gai was a refreshing change of pace. The “Golden District” in Shinjuku is a series of narrow alleyways, flanked by some of the smallest bars you’ve ever seen. Most have room for only a handful of guests and each one seems to have its own theme. It’s eccentric and quirky and a bit intimidating but also a really cool area to check out.</p>
<h3 id="6">6. Robot Restaurant</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-31134" src="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tokyo-robot-restaurant.jpg" alt="tokyo robot restaurant" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tokyo-robot-restaurant.jpg 400w, https://www.roadtrips.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tokyo-robot-restaurant-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" />And perhaps the most memorable of all is the <a href="https://shinjuku-robot.com/sp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Restaurant</a>, truly an “out there” experience. I can totally see why Anthony Bourdain recommended it and why it is a top Tokyo attraction. It is one of the wildest shows I have ever seen. Laser lights, robots, cabaret, blaring J-pop electronic music: it’s sensory overload in a great way. It also seems to be popular with celebrities; we spotted some of the cast of Vanderpump Rules during our visit. It’s a bit funny that they include restaurant in the name. Though they do have a few Bento box lunches to choose from, and some booze and popcorn, it is the show that carries the day. I would recommend grabbing a real dinner prior to going. It is hard to explain why it is so popular; it’s loud, weird, the story is impossible to follow, it’s garish&#8230; and it’s super high energy. It’s that wild quintessential mix of neon noise and anime that us Westerners don’t entirely get about Japan, and it was the coolest thing ever. I would tell all my friends to go, but not my parents.</p>
<h3 id="7">7. Tsukiji Market</h3>
<p>There were so many more wonderful experiences. Wandering the many shops and sampling the many offerings of the <a href="http://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsukiji Market</a> was also great; the sites, smells and tastes made for a great afternoon of wandering and grazing.</p>
<p>There was a memorable meal at <a href="http://www.houtou-fudou.jp/english.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Houtou Fudou</a> on my way to Mount Fuji, a traditional Japanese Udon noodle restaurant popular with locals. I snacked on fried gobo (burdock) root at a fishing pond in Musashino. I had the pleasure of sampling the light-as-air donuts from Mr. Donut. I enjoyed a cocktail complemented by some amazing city views at <a href="https://restaurants.tokyo.park.hyatt.co.jp/en/nyb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Bar in the Park Hyatt</a>, featured in the Academy Award winning movie Lost in Translation. Each experience seemed to be more incredible than the last.</p>
<p>This trip left no doubt in my mind that Tokyo is definitively one of the world’s top culinary destinations.</p>

<p><em>Roadtrips’ Lead Event Planner, Sam Buffie, spent a week in Tokyo in preparation for the 2020 <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/">Summer Games</a>. She scouted out accommodations, interviewed local partners and spent some time checking out the best places to stay in Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Games to make sure we provide our clients with the best of Tokyo. As one of our most experienced event hosts and a lifelong traveller, she’s seen more than her share of travel destinations and Tokyo was definitely a highlight. Here’s what she had to say about her trip as well as her travel tips for anyone traveling to Tokyo for the first time or, indeed, for the 2020 Summer Games!</em></p>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of traveling to Tokyo in advance of the 2020 Summer Games. Japan was recently named <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/destination-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel + Leisure’s 2018 Destination of the Year</a> and it didn’t take me long to figure out why. This incredible city surprised me in so many wonderful ways and I wanted to share some of my experiences and my tips for the best places to stay in Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Games.</p>
<h2>Is Tokyo a good place to visit?</h2>
<p>My first impression of the city was all positive. Tokyo felt clean and safe, not typically words I’d use to describe a major urban center. Traffic was a welcome surprise, in general it doesn’t seem to be an issue apart from holidays. The locals were friendly and welcoming, and even without speaking Japanese, I didn’t have much trouble communicating or getting around the city.</p>
<p><em>Related: <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/blog/is-tokyo-worth-visiting/">Is Tokyo worth visiting for the 2020 Summer Games?</a></em></p>
<h2>What are the best places to stay in Tokyo?</h2>
<p>Tokyo is such a unique city. There’s no true “downtown” core but rather a series of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own distinct flavor. I spent a lot of my time in Shinjuku and Ginza, two of Tokyo’s most popular districts. Both neighborhoods are vibrant and compelling, brimming with shops, restaurants, entertainment, and attractions.</p>
<h2>What is there to do in Shinjuku?</h2>
<p>Shinjuku was a great area to begin my trip. It’s lively and exciting with no shortage of things to do. You can find pretty much any type of restaurant you’re in the mood for, the nightlife is some of the best anywhere (I highly recommend experiencing karaoke in its home country), and the shopping is impressive to say the least. Department stores and megastores are plentiful and seriously mind-blowing. They boast floors and floors of anything you could possibly need, some 24 hours a day. Shinjuku is also home to Olympic Stadium, and will be a huge hub at the 2020 Summer Games.</p>
<h2>What is there to do in Ginza?</h2>
<p>Ginza is known as a shopper’s paradise, and has earned comparisons to Rodeo Drive. This is the place to find boutiques from the top fashion houses and upscale department stores. While shopping wasn’t high on my list of things to do this time around, I couldn’t resist taking a peek in some of these incredible shops. The department stores are bustling and their food halls were something quite incredible. I marveled at display after display of treats, from elegant pastries to fresh sushi and everything in between, each impeccably presented. In Ginza, there’s also no shortage of great restaurants and attractions, including the revered Imperial Palace.</p>
<h2>What are the best hotels in Tokyo to stay in?</h2>
<p>Shinjuku and Ginza are also home to our <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/">2020 Summer Games hotels</a>, which I visited during my trip.</p>
<h3>Park Hyatt Tokyo Review</h3>
<p>I was really excited to visit the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/#parkhyatt">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a>. The hotel, which was featured in the movie <em>Lost in Translation</em>, is a Tokyo icon. The hotel occupies the top 14 floors of three high rise towers and as you can imagine, it offers some pretty phenomenal 360 degree views. My favorite view was from the famous New York Bar on the 52nd floor. It was so cool to sit in the same bar where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson sat in <em>Lost in Translation</em> and enjoy a drink overlooking the endless twinkling lights of the city. Actually, the views everywhere were memorable, from the guest rooms to the pool to the restaurants.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Views of the famous New York Bar on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt Tokyo</p>
</div>
<h3>Hilton Tokyo Review</h3>
<p>Just a few blocks from the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku is the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/#hilton">Hilton Tokyo</a>. The location was great: convenient to Shinjuku Station, lots to explore in the area, and walkable to a variety of restaurants, shops, and green spaces. The hotel is big and has everything one would need in a hotel: great restaurants, lounges; a fitness center; indoor pool with sauna and hot tub; tennis courts; and lots more. They are currently in the process of renovating their executive lounge, which will make a great place to relax during the action of the Summer Games. The hotel also has some impressive views, including some quintessential Mt. Fuji vistas.</p>
<h3>Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi Review</h3>
<p>In Ginza, I first visited the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/#fourseasons">Four Seasons Marunouchi</a>. This boutique property felt cozy and intimate. The guest rooms were luxe and modern and there was a lovely spa that I wish I could have stayed in all day! I didn’t have a chance to try the restaurant but it is headed by a Michelin-starred chef and is a favorite of Skyetrips&#8217; President, Dave Guenther. The hotel is well located for exploring the city: just before we arrived at the hotel I got my first glimpse of the Imperial Palace grounds, which are stunning!</p>
<h3>Hyatt Centric Ginza Tokyo Review</h3>
<p>The nearby <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/tokyo-2020-packages/hotels/#hyattcentric">Hyatt Centric Ginza</a> was a pleasant surprise. It’s quite new (it opened last year) and boasts a fantastic location on the popular Namiki-dori Street, with heaps of shops and restaurants in the area. The guest rooms were contemporary with Japanese charm, and are spacious and super functional. You can tell a lot of thought went into the design. One of my most memorable meals of the trip was at the Hyatt’s Namiki667 restaurant, which had an outdoor terrace, somewhat of a rarity in Tokyo.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts about Tokyo</h2>
<p>Overall, I was so impressed with the hotels and the neighborhoods they are located in. I can confidently say that any of these properties would be a fantastic option for Summer Games travelers.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about Tokyo but I’ll save some for the next blog. Stay tuned to hear all about my favorite experiences in Japan.</p>
