The atmosphere is always incredible, the soccer is top notch and the host cities are fascinating to explore. If you love soccer, here are the 12 best soccer tournaments you’ll want to experience in your lifetime:</p>
<h2>The World Cup</h2>
<p>It’s been over three years since the last World Cup played out in Russia. Along with our clients, we had a blast. Great goals, skills, shocking wins and even greater upsets, it provided everything that makes soccer so incredible, and emphasized the very things that contribute to the passionate fanbase. </p>
<p>We are counting down the days to the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/world-cup/2022-world-cup-packages/">2022 World Cup in Qatar</a>. Qatar offers a wide array for any soccer fan. Gorgeous beaches, enticing markets, world-class museums, stunning architecture and unique landscapes. Not to mention the weather! This will be the first World Cup tournament to take place in winter, so as to allow for the climate. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is that it will be the most compact tournament yet. All eight venues are clustered in and around Doha, making this a tremendous opportunity for soccer fans to base themselves in Doha and experience multiple matches a day or follow their team without checking out of their hotel. If the 2022 World Cup is anything like the 2018 event, then it is going to be nothing short of spectacular. Will France make it two in a row?</p>

<h2>The Summer Games</h2>
<p>One of the biggest soccer tournaments in the world, the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">Summer Games</a> tournament is unique in that it features both a men’s and women’s competition. While the tournament dates way back to 1900 for the men, the women’s competition wasn’t introduced until 1996. With both winners decided in just over two weeks, it’s an action-packed tournament and lots of fun to watch. It’s also one of few sports at the Summer Games that allows guests to see events outside of the host city. In 2024, soccer matches will be played in seven Summer Games venues, including host city Paris.</p>
<p>Our favorite thing about the Summer Games Soccer Tournament is that it affords fans the opportunity to see more than just soccer. At the <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/summer-games/paris-2024-packages/">2024 Summer Games in Paris</a>, soccer fans will have the opportunity to supplement their experience with 31 other sports. Not only is it an incredible soccer experience, it’s one of the biggest sporting events in the world, hosted in one of the most fascinating countries on the planet.<br />

<h2>UEFA Champions League</h2>
<p>Another of the world’s best soccer tournaments, the UEFA Champions League sees the top clubs in Europe battle it out to earn the European Champion Clubs’ Cup. As the most watched annual sporting event in the world, it’s incredibly popular not just in Europe but around the globe. With over 60 years of history behind it, it continues to grow in popularity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skyetrips.com/soccer-packages/champions-league-final/">2022 Champions League</a> Final will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia on May 28, 2022 and there’s never been a better reason to visit this beautiful historic city. St. Petersburg Stadium (2018 World Cup host city) will make an excellent host for the 2022 Champions League Final. Regardless of who wins it all next year, we know this will be one exciting tournament.</p>

<h2>UEFA European Championship</h2>
<p>The UEFA European Championship (also known as the Euro) is another quadrennial event and takes place on the even-numbered years between World Cup years. As one of the best soccer tournaments on the continent, it determines the champion of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). A total of 24 national teams qualify to compete for the elusive title of European Champion.</p>
<p>The next edition of the UEFA European Championship will take place in Germany in 2024. A total of ten German cities will host matches, with each host city offering something unique to spectators. It promises to be a spectacular event and one not to miss!</p>
<h2>Women’s World Cup</h2>
<p>Along with the Summer Games Tournament, this is one of the biggest and best soccer tournaments in the world for women. Like the men’s tournament, it is held every four years and always highly anticipated. In 2023, 32 of the best women’s national teams (up from 24 in 2019) will compete over the course of a month for bragging rights to the title of World Cup Champion.</p>
<p>The next Women’s World Cup will take place between July 20 and August 20, 2023 and it’s going to be a good one. Why? Well, it always delivers great soccer and this edition will be held in two of the most beautiful countries in the world: Australia and New Zealand. Nine amazing cities throughout the two countries will act as Women’s World Cup hosts, providing a spectacular backdrop to the popular tournament.<br />

<h2>Copa America Finals</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most passionate festival of soccer in the world, the Copa América is an international tournament primarily for countries in South America, with a reputation for games with stunning atmospheres. Many of the greatest players in soccer history have competed in the tournament, which is the longest-running international competition in the world, predating even the World Cup.</p>
<p>The Copa America has been hosted in many of South America’s most stunning destinations, always with a passionate fan base. Though details have yet to be finalized, it is expected that the next Copa América will be hosted by Ecuador in 2024. </p>
<h2>Copa Libertadores</h2>
<p>The Copa Libertadores is the most prestigious prize in South American domestic soccer, an annual tournament to decide the best club team on the continent. It has always been the biggest competition in South America, but some high-profile and dramatic recent tournaments have seen even more global attention placed on it, in particular the 2018 final which saw historic rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors, from Buenos Aires, battle it out for the trophy.</p>
<p>The final of the 2021 tournament will take place on November 27th. This year, the final will be held in Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay, and while Palmeiras are the current champions, this is one of the most open and exciting tournaments in the world.</p>
<h2>UEFA Europa League</h2>
<p>The sister tournament to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League has gone through many guises in its history but has developed into one of the most open and exciting annual soccer competitions in the world. While the Champions League is home to most of Europe’s established superpowers, the Europa League features a much wider range of new and interesting teams and destinations.</p>
<p>The final of the 2022 Europa League is due to take place in the historic Spanish city of Seville on May 18th, 2022, and the winner not only earns the Europa League trophy, but a place in the following year’s Champions League. Spanish and English teams have dominated the Europa League in recent years, but this is a thrilling soccer tournament that anyone can win.</p>
<h2>Africa Cup of Nations</h2>
<p>The Africa Cup of Nations is a biennial tournament to decide the best international team on the continent of Africa. A total of 24 teams battle it out to determine who is the finest team in Africa, with Egypt the most successful team in the competition’s history with seven wins, and Cameroon not far behind them with five. </p>
<p>The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations will be held in Cameroon from January 9th to February 6th, 2022 after being rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament will be held in six venues across 5 cities in Cameroon, with the final hosted at the newly constructed Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé.</p>
<h2>FA Cup</h2>
<p>The FA Cup is English soccer’s most prestigious knockout tournament and the oldest soccer competition in the world. The first tournament took place in 1871, and in the 150 years since it has remained the biggest and most coveted prize in English domestic soccer. This is the best tournament in the world for an underdog story, as the FA Cup is famous for its upsets, with the smallest teams in the country frequently defeating the biggest and richest.</p>
<p>Leicester City are the current holders, while Arsenal are the most successful team in the competition’s history with 14 victories, closely followed by Manchester United with 12. The final is always held at London’s Wembley Stadium, often regarded as the &#8220;home of soccer.&#8221; The 2022 final will take place on May 14th, 2022.</p>
<h2>Copa Del Rey</h2>
<p>Founded in 1903, the Copa del Rey – or King’s Cup – is the oldest tournament in Spanish soccer and is one of the best and most historic knock-out competitions in the world. For over a century, it has seen some of the biggest and most successful clubs in world soccer compete for the historic annual prize, which predates even Spain’s domestic league competition. </p>
<p>Barcelona are the current holders and most successful team in the competition’s history, having won the Copa del Rey an amazing 31 times, while their historic rivals Real Madrid have won it 19 times. The final of the 2022 Copa del Rey will be held in one of Spain’s many glamorous destinations, which combine a rich sense of soccer history alongside some of the greatest and most desirable cities in the world, like Madrid, Barcelona and Seville.</p>
<h2>Asian Cup</h2>
<p>You could say that the Asian Cup is the biggest regional soccer competition in the world, because it determines the best international team from Asia, the biggest continent on the planet and home to over 4.5 billion people. Held for the first time in 1956, the competition is held every four years in a different Asian country each time. Previous hosts have included Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia, who are part of the Asian Football Confederation. </p>
<p>The current holders are Qatar, who won the 2019 edition held in the United Arab Emirates, while the most successful country in the competition’s history is Japan, who have been successful four times. The 2023 Asian Cup will be held in China, with the final likely to take place in Shanghai. Big soccer tournaments like this are often great ways to explore countries you might not otherwise find easy to visit, so there really is no better opportunity to visit China in 2023.</p>
