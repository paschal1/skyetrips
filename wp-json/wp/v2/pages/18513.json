The Masters is a 72-hole, four-day contest, with three practice rounds prior to the tournament rounds. The Masters is steeped in history and tradition and is an event that tops the bucket list of golf fans around the world. In addition to the huge prize purse, the winner also receives a lifetime invitation to the Masters, an invitation to every major tournament in the following five years, and the iconic and highly coveted green jacket.<\/p>\n<p>The annual home of the Masters, Augusta National Golf Club, was founded by golf legend Bobby Jones and businessman Clifford Roberts in 1931. Jones was fascinated by the rolling terrain of the area and used the space to copy holes from his favorite fairways around the world. In 1934 he invited the world\u2019s best golfers to a contest there and the Masters was born.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2023 Masters Golf Travel Packages Experience golf\u2019s most prestigious tournament at the 2023 Masters.
