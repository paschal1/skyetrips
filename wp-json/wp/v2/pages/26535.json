Some of our favorite tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring along or purchase a collapsible chair and claim your spot early in the day. Some of our favorite viewing points include the top of hole 16, Amen corner, the grandstand at 15, and halfway down 13.<\/li>\n<li>Plan your souvenir purchases carefully. If you buy too early, you\u2019ll be lugging it around all day. But if you buy too late in the tournament, you\u2019ll find little selection left. We recommend purchasing early in the tournament but near the end of the day.<\/li>\n<li>Though you can\u2019t bring your phone or camera to the tournament rounds, you can still get a picture at the Masters. Near the first hole you\u2019ll find a picture line where the club will take your picture with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure to sample the food! Augusta\u2019s pillowy soft pimento cheese sandwiches are legendary, and will only set you back about $1.50.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to grab a pairings sheet on your way in. You\u2019ll find them in a green box near the main entrance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more Masters tips, take a look at our <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/go.roadtrips.com\/guide\/augusta-travel-guide\">travel guide<\/a> <\/strong>full of tips for attending the Masters, from the practice rounds right through to the tournament rounds, to help you get the most out of your experience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_many_days_is_the_Masters_Golf_Tournament_What_is_the_best_day_to_attend_the_Masters\"><\/span>How many days is the Masters Golf Tournament?

Each day of the tournament offers something a little different and the best day to attend is largely a matter of personal preference.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wednesday offers the par 3 contest along with a more relaxed atmosphere and the option to take pictures on the course.<\/li>\n<li>Thursday or Friday affords the opportunity to see all the golfers in the field, before cuts are made.<\/li>\n<li>Sunday patrons get to witness the grand finale and often the most exciting golf action of the tournament.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_makes_the_cut_at_the_Masters_Tournament\"><\/span>Who makes the cut at the Masters Tournament?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>After round two on Friday, the top 50 players (and ties) move on.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Masters_Practice_Round_Tips\"><\/span>Masters Practice Round Tips<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Some of our favorite tips (including when you can use cameras at the Masters practice rounds) include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring a camera! Cameras are only permitted during the Masters practice rounds, not during the tournament rounds. This is your opportunity to take pictures on Augusta National.<br \/>\nMonday practice round: Cameras are allowed<br \/>\nTuesday practice round: Cameras are allowed<br \/>\nWednesday practice round: Cameras are allowed<br \/>\nTournament rounds (Thursday-Sunday): No cameras allowed\n<\/li>\n<li>While you can take pictures, you still cannot bring your phone onto the course. Make sure you bring an actual camera and don\u2019t try and sneak your phone in. Trust us, they\u2019re very strict on this rule.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to split up from others in your party, make a plan on where\/when to meet up later. The course is big and busy and the lack of cell phones makes communication obviously difficult.<\/li>\n<li>Get your shopping done early. Official Masters merchandise is only available at the course during Masters week. As the week goes on, the inventory gets more limited. The earlier in the tournament you go, the better selection you\u2019ll find.<\/li>\n<li>If you can manage to be there on Wednesday, the Par 3 contest is worth your time. It\u2019s a unique part of the tournament where you\u2019ll see the pros in a more relaxed atmosphere.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re lucky enough to have badges for the full week, the practice round days are a good time to walk the course, both to scope out good viewing spots and simply to experience it all in person.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s a good idea to mark your chair with an identifying feature if you leave it, as it may be difficult to find in a sea of chairs when you return.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to dress for the weather and wear comfortable footwear.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_is_the_current_Masters_Champion\"><\/span>Who is the current Masters Champion?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters tournament, his first win in a major championship. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_do_you_get_for_winning_the_Masters_Golf_Tournament\"><\/span>What do you get for winning the Masters Golf Tournament?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The winner of the Masters receives the iconic green jacket and also an impressive purse: in 2022, the first place prize money was $2.7 million.

The Ritz Reynolds is perched on a gorgeous piece of property overlooking picturesque Lake Oconee.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the convenience of Augusta holds a lot of appeal. The Sheraton is a really solid option and the Hilton Home2 Suites offers spacious accommodations, both convenient to restaurants, shops, and most importantly, Augusta National.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Where_can_we_eat_at_the_Masters\"><\/span>Where can we eat at the Masters?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>At Augusta National, be sure to check out the food vendors for legendary (and surprisingly inexpensive) items like the famed pimento cheese sandwich.
