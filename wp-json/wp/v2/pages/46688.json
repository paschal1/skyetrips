USA was playing in the championship final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. China was their opposition and the two teams were even at two goals a piece after extra time. The match came down to penalty kicks to decide the winner. With the penalty kicks tied at four each, Brandi Chastain scored on USA\u2019s last kick and celebrated by ripping off her jersey and dropping to her knees in her sports bra. The image is so iconic it even made the cover of Sports Illustrated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kelly Smith\u2019s Shoe Kiss<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the group stage of the 2007 tournament, England found itself down to Japan 2-0 late in the game. After Kelly Smith miraculously scored goals in the 81<sup>st<\/sup> and 83<sup>rd<\/sup> minute to tie the match, she took off her shoe and kissed it in a moment of sheer excitement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 2003 Women\u2019s World Cup Final<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2003, the final match saw Sweden face off against Germany, who had defeated host team USA in the semis. The match was tied 1-1 until the 98<sup>th<\/sup> minute, when Nia Kunzer scored a goal that Germany will never forget, clinching their first Women\u2019s World Cup Championship.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Megan Rapinoe\u2019s Rise to Fame in 2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From her stellar play, to her famous post-goal pose after scoring against France, to her role in speaking up for equal pay for women in the sport, Megan Rapinoe became a household name during the summer of 2019. The Team USA athlete also won both the Golden Ball (top player) and the Golden Boot (top goalscorer) at the tournament, as well as the title of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/sportsperson\/2019\/12\/09\/megan-rapinoe-2019-sportsperson-of-the-year\">\u201c2019 Sportsperson of the Year\u201d<\/a> by Sports Illustrated.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>For information about our <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/soccer-packages\/2023-womens-world-cup\/\"><em>2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Packages<\/em><\/a><em>, or to lock up your spot, contact one of our Sports Travel Specialists <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/custom-trip-quote\/\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em> or call 1-800-465-1765.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Ticket Disclaimer<\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Roadtrips is in no way associated with FIFA, the Organizing Committee for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2023, MATCH Services or MATCH Hospitality.
