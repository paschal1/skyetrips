This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to. The information does not usually directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalized web experience. Because we respect your right to privacy, you can <a class=\"optanon-toggle-display\">choose not to allow some types of cookies<\/a>. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we are able to offer.<\/p>\n<h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will then not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<h3>Advertising Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>Advertising cookies are placed on your computer by advertisers and ad servers in order to display advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you. These cookies allow advertisers and ad servers to gather information about your visits to the Site and other websites, alternate the ads sent to a specific computer, and track how often an ad has been viewed and by whom. These cookies are linked to a computer and do not gather any personal information about you.<\/p>\n<h3>Analytics Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>Analytics cookies monitor how users reached the Site, and how they interact with and move around once on the Site.

These cookies allow the third parties to gather and track certain information about you. These cookies can be manually disabled in your browser.<\/p>\n<h3>Performance Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our Site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site.<\/p>\n<p>All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.<br \/>\nExample: A number of our pages use cookies to remember:<br \/>\n\u2022 your display preferences, such as contrast colour settings or font size<br \/>\n\u2022 if you have already replied to a survey pop-up that asks you if the content was helpful or not (so you won\u2019t be asked again)<br \/>\n\u2022 if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this Site<br \/>\nAlso, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.<\/p>\n<p>Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the Site to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience.
