Beijing is an international air hub and travelers should have plenty of options for flights for the Winter Games. That said, we do recommend booking early as flights during major sporting events do tend to book up faster than usual.

Visitors will notice mobile payment (e.g. Alipay, WeChat) is extremely popular in Beijing, particularly with the younger generation. These apps have released international versions available to foreigners.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Where_will_the_2022_Winter_Games_be_held\"><\/span>Where will the 2022 Winter Games be held? <span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/winter-games\/2022-beijing-packages\/venues\/\">venues for the 2022 Winter Games<\/a> have been divided into three clusters in and around Beijing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Beijing Cluster<\/u> \u2013 This cluster is home to most of the ice sports venues, as well as the memorable Bird\u2019s Nest Stadium from the 2008 Summer Games, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies.<\/li>\n<li><u>Yangqing Cluster<\/u> \u2013 Located about 75 kilometers northwest of the city center, Yangqing will host the alpine skiing events and the sliding sports: bobsled, luge, and skeleton.<\/li>\n<li><u>Zhangjiakou Cluster<\/u> \u2013 This popular ski destination, approximately 180 kilometers from Beijing, will host the majority of the ski and snowboard events.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more information, please take a look at our 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/winter-games\/2022-beijing-packages\/venues\/\">Winter Games Venues Page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_transportation_options_are_there_for_the_Winter_Games_How_do_I_get_to_the_Winter_Games_events\"><\/span>What transportation options are there for the Winter Games?
