This prestigious race will take place in the crystal-clear turquoise waters of Bermuda\u2019s Great Sound, a little piece of paradise that just happens to create a natural amphitheater, making it an ideal location for the event. It\u2019s sure to be one of the hottest tickets in sport in 2017 and fortunately for race fans, there will be a number of ways to catch the sailing action.<\/p>\n<p>The Royal Naval Dockyard, home to America\u2019s Cup Village, will be the hub of the excitement next June. Here you\u2019ll find all the team bases and pit row as well as shops and plenty of great restaurants where you can grab a drink or a bite to eat. There will be plenty of entertainment as well, including concerts and lots of other race-related activities. America\u2019s Cup fans will be able to enjoy all the action on land and still enjoy the race, which will be visible from The Royal Naval Dockyard. A number of viewing areas will be set up, including grandstand seating, and fans can stake out a spot to catch the races from the shoreline or on one of the piers.<\/p>\n<h4>Grandstand Viewing<\/h4>\n<p>Dedicated grandstand seats offer fantastic views of the race course, including the finish line on Bermuda\u2019s Great Sound. Right in the heart of the action, fans will be able to enjoy the race from the comfort of their own waterside seat. This ticket also includes entry into the America\u2019s Cup Village, which features big screen TVs, live commentary and a vibrant atmosphere during this exciting event.<\/p>\n<h4>Official Spectator Boats<\/h4>\n<p>Those that want to get closer to the action can enjoy race viewing from an official spectator boat. With an official flag, these boats are positioned at various points along the course, allowing viewers to get an up-close and personal angle of the race. At approximately 60 feet long with a variety of onboard amenities, these boats have a comfortable capacity of 60-100 guests and are positioned in a great location for spectators. Special features include full AV with audio race coverage, elevated open air seating, knowledgable crew and a full bar including snacks all available for purchase. With guaranteed special designation to anchor in prime viewing along the edge of the race course, sailing fans are truly in the centre of the action here.<\/p>\n<h4>VIP Spectator Boats<\/h4>\n<p>For a more exclusive experience, we recommend an official VIP spectator boat. Similar to the official boats above, these boats will hold fewer guests for a more intimate setting and are available to be bought out by groups. Those on the VIP boats will enjoy the race from a luxurious atmosphere while enjoying complimentary wine, beer, sodas, juices and hors d\u2019oeuvres. Space on the official VIP spectator boats is quite limited and we anticipate the spots will fill quickly.<\/p>\n<h4>VIP Hospitality<\/h4>\n<p>Experience Premium Hospitality from an exclusive waterside venue in the heart of the official America\u2019s Cup Event Village. The premium Longtail Lounge provides spectators with some of the best race views possible, and large screen TVs offer additional coverage and commentary. VIP Services include a \u201cDark \u2019n\u2019 Stormy\u201d arrival reception, first class food and beverage, souvenir programme, and onsite hosts and MCs providing insight into this prestigious event. The private balcony is ideal for watching the boats race by and taking in the beautiful views across the Great Sound of Bermuda. The combination of luxury hospitality surrounded by crystal clear waters is an idyllic setting for experiencing the 2017 America\u2019s Cup.<\/p>\n<p>For the ultimate America\u2019s Cup experience, Roadtrips is excited to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/sailboat-racing-packages\/2017-americas-cup\/yacht-charters\/\">Private Yacht Charters<\/a> and other unique VIP experiences.
