Some trips need to be canceled.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nWith travel insurance, travelers don&#8217;t have to pay for a trip they are unable to take.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">Most lost luggage takes five days to return to its owner.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nTravel insurance provides coverage to replace needed items right away.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">Lost or forgotten medication?<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nTravel insurance will assist you in locating a pharmacy to purchase a new prescription.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">Travelers stateside and abroad can become ill or injured during their trip.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nTravel insurance can provide peace of mind &#8211; especially for travel outside the United States, where many hospitals request cash payments in the thousands before treatment can even begin.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">Health insurance may not go the distance.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThe majority of health insurance (including Medicare), worker&#8217;s compensation insurance, third-party and personal liability policies don&#8217;t cover international travel. In fact, a closer look at the inside of your passport will reveal that the government recommends travel insurance when traveling outside the United States.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">In the event of a natural disaster, airline strike or act of terrorism, airlines will not refund the cost of your ticket.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nTravel Insurance plans can cover the cost and help travelers get home quickly and safely.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">Credit card coverage, homeowners and auto insurance, none of these provide sufficient coverage for travel.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nEven combined, they may not offset the cost of a medical emergency overseas.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">In the unlikely case of supplier\u00a0default.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nIf a cruise line, airline or other travel provider ceases operations, travel insurance saves travelers from paying for a trip they\u2019ll really never get to take.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"s1\">We all experience tough economic times.<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nThe loss of a job or other income might mean a trip planned in advance may have to wait.
