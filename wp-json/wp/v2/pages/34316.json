In many cases, that\u2019s not all they\u2019ll receive. Many countries\u2019 competition committees also offer a cash prize to go along with the hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s more to winning than the medal and possible prize money. Winners gain notoriety \u2014 especially within their home country \u2014 and in some cases, endorsements and sponsorship deals.

Each sport is governed by an international sports federation. There are different methods determining who qualifies for the Summer Games. Some sports hold specific trial competitions. Some are based on performance over the period leading up to the Games. For team sports, the team is selected based on athletes\u2019 performance. To encourage global participation, there are limits on the number of athletes that can participate for a country in each event, as well as quotas for certain regions. The hosting country also receives automatic qualification in many events.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_other_countries_bid_to_host_the_2020_Summer_Games\"><\/span>What other countries bid to host the 2020 Summer Games?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Other countries that were interested in hosting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/\">2020 Summer Games<\/a> included Istanbul, Turkey; Madrid, Spain; Rome, Italy; Baku, Azerbaijan; and Doha, Qatar.
