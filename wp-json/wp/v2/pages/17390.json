Our best suggestion is to check the weather forecast the day before and plan accordingly. Layers are a good idea; while it may be warm in the afternoon, it often cools off in the evening, especially when the race goes late due to delays. We recommend being prepared with sunscreen and sunglasses, as well as comfortable shoes. The speedway is big and you can expect a fair amount of walking throughout the day. If rain is in the forecast, bring a poncho. Umbrellas are not permitted at Daytona International Speedway.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_happens_if_it_rains_at_the_Daytona_500\"><\/span>What happens if it rains at the Daytona 500?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While some sports will play through in the rain, auto racing is simply too dangerous to continue in wet conditions. In the case of rain, a red flag will go up calling for a rain delay. Usually once the rain passes, the track will be dried by special vehicles and the race will resume. In rare cases, the race will be called early or postponed until the following day.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div itemscope itemprop=\"mainEntity\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Question\">\n<h2 class=\"faq-question\" itemprop=\"name\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_time_should_you_arrive_at_the_Daytona_500_Speedway\"><\/span>What time should you arrive at the Daytona 500 Speedway?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\" itemscope itemprop=\"acceptedAnswer\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Answer\">\n<div itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>How early you arrive at the speedway is largely a matter of personal preference but typically a 2-3 hours prior is a good guideline if you want some time to soak in the full experience.
