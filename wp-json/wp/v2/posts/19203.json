Held annually at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Missouri, the Preakness is known for its exciting neck-and-neck finishes. The race has been decided by a head or less on 18 occasions. Although every victor to have donned the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Preakness_Stakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blanket of Black-Eyed-Susans<\/a> are champions, there are a few performances that have stood the test of time and remain some of the most memorable races in history. The following are the top five more memorable Preakness Stakes winners.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Secretariat, 1973<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Secretariat was one of the greatest horses that ever lived, and set\u00a0historic records in each of the Triple Crown races.\u00a0 During the 1973 Preakness, Secretariat was holding at a steady pace, inching toward the final stretch.\u00a0 His rider, Ron Turcotte, let him go on a fast-paced dash for the finish.\u00a0 Secretariat effortlessly finished, over two lengths ahead, leading to a historic victory.\u00a0 Called \u201cthe fastest horse on dirt,\u201d he is probably the most popular racehorse ever.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Afleet Alex, 2005<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Afleet Alex is not considered one of the greatest horses to ever win the Preakness but he had a memorable win at the Preakness of 2005.\u00a0 Afleet Alex was positioned in the middle of the track, at the top of the stretch, just beginning his surge toward the finish line.\u00a0 The Thoroughbred, Scrappy T, suddenly veered in front of him, and they clipped heels. Afleet Alex tripped severely, almost went down to his knees, and his nose nearly hit the dirt.\u00a0 His rider barely managed to stay on, however, they both recovered and Afleet Alex was victorious.\u00a0 In fact, the horse finished the Preakness in 1:55, the fastest time in eight years.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Affirmed, 1978<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Affirmed was part of, what is considered by many to be, the greatest rivalry in racing history.\u00a0 Affirmed and Alydar, his rival, raced against each other ten times as two and three year olds.\u00a0 During races, the two were consistently head-to-head. Alydar was the slight favorite for the Kentucky Derby.\u00a0 Affirmed, more known for his speed, didn\u2019t immediately take the lead until the final stretch.\u00a0 Alydar, coming from behind at ninth place, came in second, just one and a half lengths behind Affirmed.\u00a0 For the Preakness, Affirmed was the favorite.\u00a0 Affirmed took the lead from the beginning, but at the half-mark, Adler picked up speed and went from sixth place to finish second, just a neck short of victory.\u00a0 The two rivals made history.\u00a0 Affirmed, by winning the Triple Crown, and Alydar, who placed directly behind him in each of the three races.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Rachel Alexandra, 2009<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When Rachel Alexandra outran the Kentucky Derby winner, Mine That Bird, she became the fifth filly ever to win the Preakness, and the first one since 1924.\u00a0 The Preakness was not her only success, however, as she consistently broke track records, margin records, and multiple stakes records, during her career.\u00a0 In 2009, Rachel Alexandra was named Horse of the Year.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Sunday Silence, 1989<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The 1989 Preakness is considered one of the most exciting races in its history.\u00a0 Competing were two rivals, Sunday Silence, and Easy Goer.\u00a0 Easy Goer was considered the favorite for the Preakness, even though Sunday Silence won the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/kentucky-derby-packages\/\">Kentucky Derby<\/a>.\u00a0 During the Preakness, Easy Goer led the entire field all the way down to the final stretch, and then lost by a nose.\u00a0 In his entire career, Sunday Silence never finished a race less than second.<\/p>\n<p>The 144th running of the Preakness promises champion horses and intense rivalries.
