Here\u2019s why you should come with us:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Superstar Players<\/strong>. The best players in the world will come to test their skills on the famously challenging clay courts at Roland Garros Stadium. If you\u2019ve never seen a tournament played on anything other than grass, then you\u2019ll get a real kick of seeing how different it is for the players, and how it changes play. It is a real test of skill, and some of the world\u2019s greatest players were never able to take this title regardless of their standing (Pete Sampras, for example, only ever made it to the semis, and this is in part due to the fact his powerful serves bounced too high on the clay).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been watching the Australian Open, you\u2019ll know that championship has been full of drama and surprises so far. That will of course continue once the winners, and losers, get to Paris in May. At time of writing, last year\u2019s men\u2019s singles winner Stan Wawrinka had just cruised into the Australian Open\u2019s third round, so should still be a top pick to take the French title again. Ditto for women\u2019s title holder Serena Williams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Rich History. <\/strong>Officially titled Internationaux de France de Roland-Garros, and often referred to as the Roland Garros in English, this tournament has been running for 125 years. Wimbledon is older however, having been running for 138 years. It has been quipped that Wimbledon has tradition, while the French Open has passion, but in truth this tournament has plenty of both. There are many traditions that go along with the French Open that are so interesting to observe, and such fun to join in with.<\/p>\n<p>Lunch is a much-loved part of the Roland Garros experience, with the menus at the various VIP lounges and restaurants at the French Open being superb and, shockingly, this leads to empty front row seats during matches that are played at lunchtime. (This was written about in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/at-the-french-open-tennis-isnt-always-the-main-course-1433466926\">Wall Street Journal<\/a> last year.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Paris! <\/strong>The City of Lights is just incredible. When you aren\u2019t watching all that world-class tennis you can take in the wonderful architecture, fantastic cuisine, rich culture and history. We\u2019ve secured rooms and suites at some of the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/french-open-packages\/\">hotels<\/a> in the city, from the Four Seasons Hotel George V to the Park Hyatt Paris Vendome, and can arrange tours both in the city and anywhere else in France that you\u2019ve always dreamed of visiting.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-13172 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/banner-four-seasons.jpg\" alt=\"banner-four-seasons\" width=\"1100\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>New York based journalist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rolandgarros.com\/en_FR\/news\/articles\/2015-10-08\/what_i_love_about_roland_garros.html\">Nick McCarvel writes that the French Open oozes elegance and intimacy<\/a>, and we couldn\u2019t agree more. For tennis fans, this has to be one of the most incredible sports travel experiences out there, and should be top of any true fan\u2019s bucket list.
