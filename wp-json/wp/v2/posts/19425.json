For football fans there is no bigger event on the NFL calendar, and after an incredible Super Bowl last year, we truly cannot wait to see what happens at next year\u2019s epic showdown. Houston is a fantastic city to visit, and we\u2019re lining up some exceptional experiences for our Super Bowl guests next year.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/monaco-grand-prix-packages\/\">Monaco Grand Prix<\/a>, Monte Carlo, May 25<sup>th<\/sup> \u2013 29<sup>th<\/sup><\/strong>. Heading to Monte Carlo every year for the Grand Prix is always a thrill for the Roadtrips team. There\u2019s no other event in the world this glamorous and cool to attend. Seeing those fine F1 cars speed through the streets of historic Monaco is awe-inspiring, and the events around the race are always thrilling. In Monaco you get to hob-nob with stars and royalty, and experience some of the finest racing you\u2019ll ever see anywhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/french-open-packages\/\">French Open<\/a>, Paris, France, May 28<sup>th<\/sup> \u2013 June 11<sup>th<\/sup><\/strong>.

This will be the first time that the pinnacle of international sailing has come to Bermuda, and the Islands are an excellent fit for this event because the weather is pretty much always perfect for sailing. Couple that with the fact that Bermuda is a superb luxury destination full of charm and sophistication, and you have a recipe for the ultimate sports-centered vacation.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/euro-soccer-packages\/\">Champions League Final<\/a>, Cardiff, Wales, June 2<sup>nd<\/sup> \u2013 4<sup>th<\/sup><\/strong>. Did you know that this is the most watching annual sporting event in the world? 300 million soccer fans tuned in to watch last year, because watching the very best of Europe\u2019s teams battle it out on the pitch is epic \u2013 and getting to see it played out live in front of you? Amazing.
