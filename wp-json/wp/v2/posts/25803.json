Along with our clients, we had a blast. Great goals, skills, shocking wins and even greater upsets, it provided everything that makes soccer so incredible, and emphasized the very things that contribute to the passionate fanbase. <\/p>\n<p>We are counting down the days to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/world-cup\/2022-world-cup-packages\/\">2022 World Cup in Qatar<\/a>. Qatar offers a wide array for any soccer fan. Gorgeous beaches, enticing markets, world-class museums, stunning architecture and unique landscapes. Not to mention the weather! This will be the first World Cup tournament to take place in winter, so as to allow for the climate. <\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the best part about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is that it will be the most compact tournament yet. All eight venues are clustered in and around Doha, making this a tremendous opportunity for soccer fans to base themselves in Doha and experience multiple matches a day or follow their team without checking out of their hotel. If the 2022 World Cup is anything like the 2018 event, then it is going to be nothing short of spectacular. Will France make it two in a row?<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6\" class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\"><span id=\"hs-cta-4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6\" class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6\"><!-- [if lte IE 8]>\n\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/2166909\/4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img id=\"hs-cta-img-4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6\" class=\"hs-cta-img\" style=\"border-width: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/2166909\/4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6.png\" alt=\"Download a World Cup Brochure\" \/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(2166909, '4589feda-42dc-4ab5-9ce6-2735a7005af6', {}); <\/script><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_25809\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-25809\" class=\"wp-image-25809 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/world-cup-russia.jpeg\" alt=\"photo taken at the 2018 world cup in russia by a roadtrips host\" width=\"680\"\/><p id=\"caption-attachment-25809\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Taken at the 2018 World Cup in Russia by Roadtrips Hosts<\/p><\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Summer_Games\"><\/span>The Summer Games<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest soccer tournaments in the world, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/paris-2024-packages\/\">Summer Games<\/a> tournament is unique in that it features both a men\u2019s and women\u2019s competition. While the tournament dates way back to 1900 for the men, the women\u2019s competition wasn\u2019t introduced until 1996. With both winners decided in just over two weeks, it\u2019s an action-packed tournament and lots of fun to watch. It\u2019s also one of few sports at the Summer Games that allows guests to see events outside of the host city. In 2024, soccer matches will be played in seven Summer Games venues, including host city Paris.<\/p>\n<p>Our favorite thing about the Summer Games Soccer Tournament is that it affords fans the opportunity to see more than just soccer.

Like the men\u2019s tournament, it is held every four years and always highly anticipated.

Many of the greatest players in soccer history have competed in the tournament, which is the longest-running international competition in the world, predating even the World Cup.<\/p>\n<p>The Copa America has been hosted in many of South America\u2019s most stunning destinations, always with a passionate fan base. Though details have yet to be finalized, it is expected that the next Copa Am\u00e9rica will be hosted by Ecuador in 2024. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Copa_Libertadores\"><\/span>Copa Libertadores<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Copa Libertadores is the most prestigious prize in South American domestic soccer, an annual tournament to decide the best club team on the continent. It has always been the biggest competition in South America, but some high-profile and dramatic recent tournaments have seen even more global attention placed on it, in particular the 2018 final which saw historic rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors, from Buenos Aires, battle it out for the trophy.<\/p>\n<p>The final of the 2021 tournament will take place on November 27th. This year, the final will be held in Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay, and while Palmeiras are the current champions, this is one of the most open and exciting tournaments in the world.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"UEFA_Europa_League\"><\/span>UEFA Europa League<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The sister tournament to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League has gone through many guises in its history but has developed into one of the most open and exciting annual soccer competitions in the world. While the Champions League is home to most of Europe\u2019s established superpowers, the Europa League features a much wider range of new and interesting teams and destinations.<\/p>\n<p>The final of the 2022 Europa League is due to take place in the historic Spanish city of Seville on May 18th, 2022, and the winner not only earns the Europa League trophy, but a place in the following year\u2019s Champions League. Spanish and English teams have dominated the Europa League in recent years, but this is a thrilling soccer tournament that anyone can win.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Africa_Cup_of_Nations\"><\/span>Africa Cup of Nations<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Africa Cup of Nations is a biennial tournament to decide the best international team on the continent of Africa. A total of 24 teams battle it out to determine who is the finest team in Africa, with Egypt the most successful team in the competition\u2019s history with seven wins, and Cameroon not far behind them with five. <\/p>\n<p>The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations will be held in Cameroon from January 9th to February 6th, 2022 after being rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament will be held in six venues across 5 cities in Cameroon, with the final hosted at the newly constructed Olembe Stadium in Yaound\u00e9.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"FA_Cup\"><\/span>FA Cup<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The FA Cup is English soccer\u2019s most prestigious knockout tournament and the oldest soccer competition in the world. The first tournament took place in 1871, and in the 150 years since it has remained the biggest and most coveted prize in English domestic soccer. This is the best tournament in the world for an underdog story, as the FA Cup is famous for its upsets, with the smallest teams in the country frequently defeating the biggest and richest.<\/p>\n<p>Leicester City are the current holders, while Arsenal are the most successful team in the competition\u2019s history with 14 victories, closely followed by Manchester United with 12. The final is always held at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, often regarded as the &#8220;home of soccer.&#8221; The 2022 final will take place on May 14th, 2022.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Copa_Del_Rey\"><\/span>Copa Del Rey<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Founded in 1903, the Copa del Rey \u2013 or King\u2019s Cup \u2013 is the oldest tournament in Spanish soccer and is one of the best and most historic knock-out competitions in the world. For over a century, it has seen some of the biggest and most successful clubs in world soccer compete for the historic annual prize, which predates even Spain\u2019s domestic league competition. <\/p>\n<p>Barcelona are the current holders and most successful team in the competition\u2019s history, having won the Copa del Rey an amazing 31 times, while their historic rivals Real Madrid have won it 19 times. The final of the 2022 Copa del Rey will be held in one of Spain\u2019s many glamorous destinations, which combine a rich sense of soccer history alongside some of the greatest and most desirable cities in the world, like Madrid, Barcelona and Seville.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Asian_Cup\"><\/span>Asian Cup<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You could say that the Asian Cup is the biggest regional soccer competition in the world, because it determines the best international team from Asia, the biggest continent on the planet and home to over 4.5 billion people. Held for the first time in 1956, the competition is held every four years in a different Asian country each time. Previous hosts have included Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia, who are part of the Asian Football Confederation. <\/p>\n<p>The current holders are Qatar, who won the 2019 edition held in the United Arab Emirates, while the most successful country in the competition\u2019s history is Japan, who have been successful four times. The 2023 Asian Cup will be held in China, with the final likely to take place in Shanghai. Big soccer tournaments like this are often great ways to explore countries you might not otherwise find easy to visit, so there really is no better opportunity to visit China in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to hear more about any of the best soccer tournaments in the world, we\u2019d love to help you out.
