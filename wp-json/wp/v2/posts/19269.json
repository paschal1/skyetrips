Besides making firm friendships, Norm also met his wife at the company (and several work friends attended his wedding a few weeks ago). &#8220;It is a special group of people,&#8221; agrees Brian, &#8220;We are more like a family. We&#8217;re here for each other, and of course we all love sports which helps us get on well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All of us at Roadtrips are proud and happy to work in an environment where people love their jobs and stick around because they like it here so much. Dave Guenther, Duane Penner, Jeff Wills and Kate Burzynski are more of our\u00a0employees with 10+ years as part of the Roadtrips team. We know that having\u00a0employees who love their job is one reason we&#8217;re able to meet and go above our clients&#8217; expectations when it comes to delivering excellent customer service.
