There has been a surge in popularity in women\u2019s soccer in recent years and in particular, a huge increase in interest in the Women\u2019s World Cup and the 2019 tournament is set to be one of the biggest &#8211; not just in soccer &#8211; but in women\u2019s sports. To give some perspective on this growth, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/272800\/average-number-of-spectatators-at-the-fifa-womens-world-cup\/\">Statista<\/a>, the average attendance in 1991 was 19,615. Four years later in the US, a staggering 37,319. The host country certainly has an influence on the figures. The average attendance at the 2015 World Cup in Canada was 26,029. With France hosting, it\u2019s likely to massively boost attendance figures for the 2019 tournament.<\/p>\n<p>While this interest has increased worldwide, nowhere has it had such a dramatic spike, than in North America.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s get right into it &#8211; here are four factors that are contributing to the surge in popularity of the Women\u2019s World Cup.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#usa\">The Success of the United States National Team.<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#host\">The Host Nation &#8211; France.<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#play\">The Quality of Play.<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#momentum\">The Momentum of the 2018 World Cup.<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 id=\"usa\"><strong>The Success of the United States National Team<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the biggest contributors to the rise in popularity of women\u2019s soccer. The United States Women\u2019s soccer team is very successful &#8211; even more so than their male counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>Since the inception of the Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991 &#8211; this tournament taking place in China &#8211; the United States national team have won three tournaments. Germany are in second place, with two.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, the Women\u2019s World Cup Final between the United States and Japan was one of the most watched soccer matches in the history of American television. Now that\u2019s a monumental accolade! Roughly 23 million &#8211; yes, million &#8211; Americans tuned in to watch the United States take their third title. For comparison, the 2014 Men\u2019s World Cup Final was watched by an average of 17 million Americans.<\/p>\n<p>This upwards trend follows the 1999 World Cup victory by the United States &#8211; which was when the sport really went global. According to US Youth Soccer, soccer participation went up by 37% in the last twenty years!<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that the success of the United States Women\u2019s team has spurred the surge in the popularity in the sport, and we can expect to see similar interest and viewing figures next year in France, which brings us nicely to the next reason\u2026<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"host\"><strong>The Host Nation &#8211; France<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t want to go to France? It\u2019s a huge tourist destination and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/5-sports-road-trips-that-must-be-on-your-bucket-list\/\">bucket list trip<\/a> for a lot of people &#8211; particularly those from North America. The 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup will be taking place in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/soccer-packages\/2019-womens-world-cup\/venues\/\">nine host venues<\/a>. France is an incredible host country &#8211; each city an amazing destination in itself.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s Grenoble, Nice, Montpellier, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/soccer-packages\/2019-womens-world-cup\/area-map\/\">Lyon<\/a>, Reims, Paris, Le Havre, Valenciennes or Rennes, you\u2019ll find historic venues to modern state of the art stadiums. Whether you\u2019re keen to explore the romantic metropolis of Paris, the history of Lyon, the mountains of Grenoble or the glamorous beaches of Nice &#8211; France really does offer it all and the Women\u2019s World Cup provides the perfect excuse to finally take that trip that you\u2019ve always dreamed of!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/soccer-packages\/2019-womens-world-cup\/hotels\/\">Beautiful hotels<\/a> and no shortage of things to see and do (as if the soccer won\u2019t be enough!), you\u2019ll be spoiled for choice!<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenal location, paired with one of the biggest soccer tournaments in the sport, and you\u2019ve got a very, very tempting combination.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"play\"><strong>The Quality of Play<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Women\u2019s soccer has come on leaps and bounds in the past few decades. This comes from the investment in the sport following successes of women\u2019s soccer teams such as the United States which has led to increased exposure and recognition. There has always been a huge roster of talent, but the recent successes and exposure of the sport has led to that increased investment and as a result, an even better standard of play.<\/p>\n<p>A women\u2019s soccer match will provide all of the ups, downs, excitements and disappointment, along with a heavy dose of skill, flair and finesse that upon watching, quickly justifies the enormous viewing figures for finals.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of players are now becoming household names too. The United States, unsurprisingly, boasting some of the most recognizable ones.<\/p>\n<p>Carli Lloyd for example, who scored a sensational 16 minute hat trick in 1999. Hope Solo has cemented herself as one of the best goalkeepers in women\u2019s soccer and Alex Morgan has gained international attention for her attacking prowess, scoring 92 goals in 148 appearances for the United States. That\u2019s an impressive record!<\/p>\n<p>The skill, talent and quality of play will be on full display in France for the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup come June next year, and we can\u2019t wait to see what it has to offer.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"momentum\"><strong>The Momentum of the 2018 World Cup<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By no means is this taking away from the aforementioned points, though it is worth mentioning. The success of France in the 2018 Men\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/world-cup\/2022-world-cup-packages\/\">World Cup<\/a> will act as a catalyst going forward into the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup.<\/p>\n<p>The host country are world champions, and now as the best in women\u2019s world soccer are set to compete for honors, all eyes will again be on France. Can they make a challenge, or will the might of the United States sweep the competition aside? It seems like it\u2019s a lifetime away, but next Summer will be here before we know it, and we can\u2019t wait.<\/p>\n<p>There you have it, four reasons we think are contributing to the surge in popularity and interest in the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup and in general, women\u2019s soccer.<\/p>\n<p>France is certain to be a brilliant host, with each city offering their own attractions and a diverse range of things to see and do. The talent and standard of play will bring exciting and memorable football, just like past tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>Are you going to the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup?
