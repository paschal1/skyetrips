Kaylor joined the Roadtrips team in April 2015 as our Director of Business Development. \u201cI wear a lot of hats, but mainly my job is to educate travel agents and the various consortiums that we are a part of about sports travel,\u201d he says, \u201cBut outside of that I also take care of all our groups and incentives at travel trade shows around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16926\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_0052-2-250x345.jpg\" alt=\"Dustin Kaylor\" width=\"250\" height=\"345\" \/>Kaylor is based in Colorado, but is pretty much always on the road, and had just arrived in Los Angeles from New York at the time of this interview. \u201cI always try and make the most of the travel, and enjoy it. It doesn\u2019t feel like work most of the time,\u201d he says. Before coming to work with us, Kaylor was with a South American tour operator, working on World Cup packages for Rio \u2013 a country he had spent a lot of time in before that event, which helped him be a fantastic host for us by the time the Rio Summer Games rolled around.<\/p>\n<p>Being at the Summer Games was an epic experience, and there were many highlights for Kaylor. \u201cSeeing the interactions between the Roadtrips team, our local staff, and the guests, and seeing how everyone fell in love with Rio, and how any apprehension about the city just melted away, that was just the best,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of upcoming events that Kaylor is looking forward to, with the America\u2019s Cup in Bermuda at the top of the list right now. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to go spend a month in paradise?\u201d he laughs, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be just huge for me. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_Summer_Olympics\">Tokyo for the Summer Games<\/a> \u00a0is of course going to be awesome too,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Going to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/seven-reasons-why-the-2018-world-cup-is-going-to-be-epic\/\">World Cup<\/a> in Russia is also a really big deal for him. \u201cI love soccer, and have always been fascinated by Russia like most people my age who\u2019ve lived through the Cold War. And the thing about the World Cup is that it makes you see a whole lot of the country \u2013 if you followed Team USA at the last World Cup you had to go all over Brazil,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Being in Rio as part of the Roadtrips team really gave Kaylor the opportunity to experience the Roadtrips difference. \u201cI respect it so much, to have all the logistics taken care of, it takes away so much of the stress of traveling to somewhere that you don\u2019t know the language, or that you\u2019re unsure of,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not the cheapest option out there, and we certainly do not shy away from that, but we are absolutely the best value in the Sports Travel industry without a doubt.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Ready to book your first (or next) Roadtrips experience?
