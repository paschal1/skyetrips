The Japanese capital\u2019s electric cityscape, UNESCO-recognized culinary heritage, quirky subcultures, and rags-to-riches history put it atop many Americans\u2019 travel bucket lists &#8212; a trend expected to continue.<\/p>\n<p>During this meteoric rise, Japanese cultural differences from the western world have reached a point of clich\u00e9: the unfailing punctuality of the Japanese people, the efficiency of the transport network, the politeness of the locals and their inference on customer service, or how restaurants and bars \u2013 when you can finally locate them \u2013 exist on a charmingly miniature scale.<\/p>\n<p>But there is a reason such clich\u00e9s exist. Japan was closed off to the rest of the world for over 200 years from the 17<sup>th<\/sup> to 19<sup>th<\/sup> centuries \u2013 known as the Sakoku Period \u2013 during which time the nation simmered exclusively in its own culture, free from the hands of outside influence. As such, Japanese cultural norms developed in a singular fashion, much of which is still apparent today.<\/p>\n<p>When comparing Japanese culture vs American culture, the primary differences stem from the diametrically opposed foundations upon which Japanese and the US society were built: collectivism vs individualism. This is the root cause of the cultural differences you\u2019ll need to consider when visiting Japan on your travels.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_11 counter-hierarchy counter-numeric ez-toc-grey\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\"><i class=\"ez-toc-glyphicon ez-toc-icon-toggle\"><\/i><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class=\"ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1\"><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Always_Carry_Cash\" title=\"Always Carry Cash\">Always Carry Cash<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Smoking_Laws_are_Confusing\" title=\"Smoking Laws are Confusing\">Smoking Laws are Confusing<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Where_Are_All_the_Trash_Cans\" title=\"Where Are All the Trash Cans?\">Where Are All the Trash Cans?<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#ALWAYS_Carry_Your_Passport\" title=\"ALWAYS Carry Your Passport\">ALWAYS Carry Your Passport<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Observe_Train_Etiquette\" title=\"Observe Train Etiquette\">Observe Train Etiquette<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Don%E2%80%99t_Fret_Over_Tipping\" title=\"Don\u2019t Fret Over Tipping\">Don\u2019t Fret Over Tipping<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Communication_Can_Be_Indirect\" title=\"Communication Can Be Indirect\">Communication Can Be Indirect<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Punctuality_is_Key\" title=\"Punctuality is Key\">Punctuality is Key<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Omotenashi_%E2%80%93_The_Art_of_Customer_Service\" title=\"Omotenashi \u2013 The Art of Customer Service\">Omotenashi \u2013 The Art of Customer Service<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/cultural-differences-between-japan-and-the-usa\/#Toilets_of_the_Future\" title=\"Toilets of the Future\">Toilets of the Future<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Always_Carry_Cash\"><\/span>Always Carry Cash<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46599 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cash.jpg\" alt=\"tokyo cash payment\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cash.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cash-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>Japan may love robots, electronic toilets, and neon-flanked highways, but its high-tech image is, frankly, a bit of a misnomer. At the level of general business infrastructure \u2013 which includes cashless payment systems \u2013 Japan is actually lagging quite far behind the US and the rest of the developed world.<\/p>\n<p>As such, it\u2019s recommended to have cash, always. Some bank ATMs will support foreign credit\/debit cards, usually indicated by a sign above the machine. While almost all convenience stores, which are as a rule open 24\/7, will have ATMs, and these should work with all foreign credit\/debit cards.<\/p>\n<p>Hotels, classy restaurants, and big chain stores will usually accept card payment methods, but at street level, especially in the independent brick and mortars, cash reigns supreme.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Smoking_Laws_are_Confusing\"><\/span>Smoking Laws are Confusing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46600 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/smoking.jpg\" alt=\"smoking in japan vs american culture\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/smoking.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/smoking-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>One of the most bizarre cultural differences between the US and Japan are the laws around smoking. Restrictions on smoking indoors were recently implemented in Tokyo with a view to the since-postponed 2020 Summer Games (rescheduled for July 2021).<\/p>\n<p>However, in smaller bars and restaurants in the capital it\u2019s not uncommon to wine and dine in the company of plumes of tobacco smoke &#8212; and beyond the prefectural borders of greater Tokyo, you\u2019ll find yet more smoke-friendly restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to the United States, smoking outside is also a social faux pas, if not outright forbidden as it is on the streets of Japan\u2019s major urban areas. Rather, you\u2019ll see \u2013 or smell \u2013 designated smoking areas which sit on street corners as open-air booths. Alternatively, smokers may be directed to small ventilated rooms within restaurants or deep within the bowels of buildings.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Where_Are_All_the_Trash_Cans\"><\/span>Where Are All the Trash Cans?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46608 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/trash-cans.jpg\" alt=\"trash cans in japan stand out for tourists visiting\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/trash-cans.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/trash-cans-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Japanese trash cans are great\u2026 when you can find them, that is. Drift by tourists on the streets of Tokyo and you\u2019ll soon hear one of the most commonly voiced chagrins: \u201cHow are these streets so clean, yet I can never\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/livejapan.com\/en\/in-tokyo\/in-pref-tokyo\/in-shibuya\/article-a0002380\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">find a trash can<\/a>?\u201d Though public trash cans have slowly begun to appear, their scarcity is still apparent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">In Japan, it is typical to sort your own trash \u2013 of which you\u2019ll often gather a lot thanks to the surplus of convenience stores and vending machines \u2013 before bringing it home to deposit in the correct waste bins. Nowadays, in certain train stations and most convenience stores, you\u2019ll find trash cans marked with Japanese script and an accompanying picture indicating what goes inside: PET bottles, cans, glass, burnable waste, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ALWAYS_Carry_Your_Passport\"><\/span>ALWAYS Carry Your Passport<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-46607\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/passport.jpg\" alt=\"passports in tokyo japan\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/passport.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/passport-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>One of the cultural similarities between the US and Japan, though it\u2019s only effected upon visitors, is the mandate that all legal aliens must carry a passport on them at all times. This may seem a little austere, and is no joy for the traveler who tends to leave things astray, but it is a rule and the local police are permitted to detain any who breach it.<\/p>\n<p>The Japanese police are not guaranteed to speak English to any degree of competence, meaning the process for engineering your exit back out of the precinct will likely be long and laborious. Additionally, during global events, Japanese police tend to patrol in greater numbers and are known for carrying out random ID checks.<\/p>\n<p>So just to reiterate: Carry your passport.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Observe_Train_Etiquette\"><\/span>Observe Train Etiquette<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-46606\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tokyo-trains.jpg\" alt=\"train etiquette in japan\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tokyo-trains.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tokyo-trains-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>Train etiquette is one of the most obvious examples of the differences in western individualism and Japanese collectivism. In Japan, people tend to avoid acting in any way that may be deemed insensitive, offensive, egregious, or even mildly off-putting to those around them. Japanese people tend to focus on maintaining the <em>\u2018wa\u2019 <\/em>\u2013 the collective harmony; the social order.<\/p>\n<p>What this means in practice \u2013 on trains at least \u2013 is carriages crammed full of people which lull along the tracks in almost complete silence. To help maintain this atmosphere of <em>\u2018wa\u2019 <\/em>when using Japan\u2019s public transport system: refrain from eating, drinking, talking loudly, sneezing, and be sure to turn your phone on silent; basically, do as the Japanese do.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Don%E2%80%99t_Fret_Over_Tipping\"><\/span>Don\u2019t Fret Over Tipping<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46605 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tipping.jpg\" alt=\"tipping in tokyo difference between USA\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tipping.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/tipping-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>There is a rare story one hears in Japan, usually whispered in hushed tones by someone who\u2019s been privy to that most unusual of scenarios: the Japanese waiter who accepts a tip. Though it would be disingenuous to say this never happens, your chances of spotting a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow are approximately as high.<\/p>\n<p>If you simply cannot resist the urge to tip, expect to get chased down the road with a handful of yen coins rather than the recipient staff bowing graciously as they accept your generous imbursement. This is arguably the biggest difference in Japanese and US social etiquette. But don\u2019t let it concern you, Japanese restaurant and bar staff are typically well compensated by their employers, and view tipping as unnecessary rather than downright rude.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Communication_Can_Be_Indirect\"><\/span>Communication Can Be Indirect<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46604 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/communication.jpg\" alt=\"communication in japan\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/communication.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/communication-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>Mastering the dark arts of Japanese communication has baffled foreigners since they first began to arrive en masse in the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> century. This is largely due to Japan\u2019s indirect methods of communication and even their body language \u2013 a holdover from the days of the samurai when maintaining peace was priority number one \u2013 which stands in stark contrast to the more up-front and personal style of communication in the west.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not just the <em>gaijin <\/em>(foreigners) who find it confounding. When Emperor Hirohito broadcast live Japan\u2019s surrender in WWII, he used such an archaic and indirect form of the language that many weren\u2019t entirely sure of what he was saying.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, when you get a response to a question along the lines of \u201cit might be difficult\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d, this is often shorthand for no. Or maybe it\u2019s not. You may have to read between the lines.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Punctuality_is_Key\"><\/span>Punctuality is Key<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-46603\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/time.jpg\" alt=\"punctuality in japan time\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/time.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/time-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>Japanese people, particularly within Japanese business culture, see punctuality not as a mere sign of respect, but an unequivocal virtue \u2013 to the extent they\u2019ll sometimes arrive for meetings precisely at the agreed upon time, not a minute early or late. So, just bear in mind, showing up when you please in Japan may be considered more disrespectful than in other parts of the world. This is not to say all Americans forego timekeeping, but rather to reinforce the point: the Japanese take punctuality very, very seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point: trains in Japan are almost always on time. Ultimately there is still a margin for human error, such as the story which made international headlines in 2017 when the Tsukuba Express Line management apologized profusely for a train that departed 20 seconds ahead of schedule. Few train networks in the world however, could claim to be quite as efficient or punctual as the Japanese system.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Omotenashi_%E2%80%93_The_Art_of_Customer_Service\"><\/span>Omotenashi \u2013 The Art of Customer Service<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><em><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-46602 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hospitality.jpg\" alt=\"Omotenashi hospitality in Japan\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hospitality.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hospitality-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>Omotenashi <\/em>is one of Japan\u2019s many untranslatable terms. But generally, it\u2019s ascribed to the country\u2019s famed customer service; something hinged upon rigorous protocol which has been tuned over the centuries into a fine art. It\u2019s another component of Japanese culture which is, in its own way, singular &#8212; and it is apparent everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Think it of <em>omotenashi<\/em> as predicting the customer&#8217;s needs before he\/she knows what said needs are: hot towels in winter or cold towels in summer on arrival at a restaurant, store clerks who greet shoppers with the most courteous Japanese phrases (known as <em>\u201ckeigo\u201d <\/em>\u2013 respectful language) and deep bows, or slippers to use in the bathroom when you\u2019re in a no-shoes establishment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.japan.travel\/en\/au\/experience\/culture\/omotenashi\/\"><em>Omotenashi<\/em><\/a> focuses on the little things, which often make all the difference.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Toilets_of_the_Future\"><\/span>Toilets of the Future<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-46601\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/japanese-toilet.jpg\" alt=\"japanese toilet\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/japanese-toilet.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/japanese-toilet-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/>At first, Japanese toilets can seem wildly complicated and may come as a culture shock. Many foreigners, more familiar with the standard chain or lever system, find the control panels with flashing buttons overwhelming. However, most buttons come with <em>fairly<\/em> explanatory photos, and if in doubt, look out for \u201c\u5927\u201d (big flush) and \u201c\u5c0f\u201d (little flush). Also feel free to fiddle around with the controls \u2013 there is no ejector seat button.<\/p>\n<p>Once you become well-acquainted with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2sUKYAoUaG4\">electronic Japanese toilet<\/a> and its jets of water, in-built nature soundscapes, and multiple flushing options, returning to your old model may fill you with melancholy. But you take solace in the fact that you\u2019re not alone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Roadtrips Summer 2021 Exclusive Travel Plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you are well versed in the cultural differences between US and Japan &#8212; though you will no doubt discover some more along the way &#8212; join Roadtrips in Japan for our highly anticipated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/\">2021 Summer Games Travel Packages.<\/a> Our exclusive, experiential plans will help you get the most out of a once-in-a-lifetime Summer Games vacation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During the past decade Japan has grown into one of the world\u2019s top travel destinations \u2013 helped in no small part by hosting a series of global sporting showcases, including the upcoming 2021 Summer Games in Tokyo.
