Not only does he know how to find you the best restaurants in Monte Carlo\/ the most fun family activities in London\/ or how to hook you up with whatever else you&#8217;re into wherever you are, but he knows international sporting events inside out.\u00a0In 2013, Duane Penner was named a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.travelandleisure.com\/a-list\" target=\"_blank\">Travel + Leisure Magazine A-List Super Agent<\/a>, and the best in his field, for\u00a0International Sports Travel Events. We asked Duane a few questions about his life as a Roadtrips team member, and here&#8217;s what he had to say.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What makes you so good at what you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a combination of things. For one, I&#8217;ve been involved in sports travel for a long time so I do know my stuff, part of that is just being this old! Also, we specialize very much in the international sporting events while in North America many of our competitors concentrate on domestic events, which they are very good at.\u00a0I don&#8217;t know any other North American agents that have been to the Monaco Grand Prix as many times as I have [twelve times] or agencies that are as committed to international events as Roadtrips is. These things have both helped me rise to the top in this category.\u00a0I think the fact that I love these sporting events, and I love to travel, also helps me be good at this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is\u00a0your favorite sporting event to attend?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/monaco-grand-prix-packages\/\">Monaco Grand Prix<\/a> is definitely one of my favourites. I love that part of the world, and because I&#8217;ve been so many times I know it so well. I tell people that even if they aren&#8217;t auto-racing fans, everyone needs to do that trip once in their life. Monaco is a great travel destination, and being there during the Grand Prix is fantastic because there&#8217;s that glamour and history, the beautiful people, the yachts &#8211; there\u00a0are\u00a0so many things that make it a super cool event.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will you be in Brazil for the Summer Games next year?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, and I was there last year for 40 days over the World Cup. We recognize that in order to make these events special for people, we have to know our stuff, so we make a commitment to go back and forth between destinations before every event. We hire local hosts too, but sometimes we&#8217;ve had staff go six months in advance and live in a destination in order to build relationships and really understand the destination\u00a0in order to deliver on it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It sounds like you love what you do.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked at Roadtrips for sixteen years, and I do love it. We have a great culture here, and very few people leave. Working here you get to see different parts of the world, sporting events, and other interesting things &#8211; there are lots of neat perks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you always loved travel?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Definitely. I spent almost a decade backpacking and working just to travel, hoofing around on nickels. I love sports, but I probably love travel even more. I went to Italy, Austria, and France this summer with my family, we just love traveling, and I went in advance with my middle daughter to Rome to do a cooking school for a few days.\u00a0Traveling with kids is awesome, and that&#8217;s probably some of the best feedback I get in my job, seeing families having a great time at these major events, it is always super rewarding seeing guests&#8217; kids having a blast.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11748\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11748\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-11748 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Duane-family.jpg\" alt=\"Duane family\" width=\"998\" height=\"733\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-11748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duane with his family in Paris<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Whatever sporting event is on your bucket-list, our knowledgable staff can help you get there and organize the very best itinerary to meet your travel goals. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> to see how we can help you have\u00a0the trip of a lifetime.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been fortunate enough to have Duane Penner hosting a Roadtrips event that you attended, you&#8217;ll know that he is a great guy to be around.
