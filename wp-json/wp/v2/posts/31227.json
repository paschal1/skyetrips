It was here sometime in the 15th century that our (fore)fathers began to develop the game we know and love today. The Old Course in St. Andrews on the east coast of Scotland is home to the prestigious Royal and Ancient Golf Club, the oldest of its kind in the world, founded in 1754. There are no less than six beautiful and challenging courses here, but the highlight is undoubtedly the famous double greens and Swilcan Bridge &#8211; a 700-year-old golfing Mecca.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31232\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31232\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-31232 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course.jpg\" alt=\"Old Course, St Andrews Golf Course\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Old-Course-St-Andrews-Golf-Course-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-31232\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iconic.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Old Course, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geograph.org.uk\/photo\/5347500\">Old Course, St Andrews<\/a>&#8221; by G Laird is licensed under CC BY 2.0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And after a day enjoying the fineries that you can experience on the green, St. Andrews is an ancient delight, known for its Cathedral, the ruins of St. Andrews Castle, and &#8211; of course &#8211; the excellent British Golf Museum &#8211; which no true fan should miss.

Since 1934, the best of the best battle for the coveted green jacket over links designed by founder Bobby Jones and the great golf course architect Dr. Alister MacKenzie. It has been extended and improved significantly over the years to keep it a consistent challenge. A former plant nursery, every hole is named after a tree or shrub, giving you an indication of just how gorgeous this vividly emerald course is.

Opening back in 1936 and located on Long Island, this green has grown into a very demanding 18, famous as a driver\u2019s course because of its long fairways. Designed by US golf architect A.W. Tillinghast, it rightly gets considerable praise from golfing greats, particularly as it\u2019s accessible to the public yet maintains its quality as much as any exclusive club. Its PGA debut is set to be a memorable experience for all attending.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31237\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31237\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-31237 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Liberty New York\" width=\"747\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York.jpg 747w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Statue-of-Liberty-New-York-300x189.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-31237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lady Liberty at sunset.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to golf trip ideas, adding a city like New York into the mix has the potential to offer some truly world-class hospitality. You\u2019ll never be short of anything to see or do in the Big Apple when taking some downtime from the action. Take in a show on Broadway, enjoy a birds-eye view from the Empire State, or people watch at Times Square. The city is filled with golfing stores too, making it one of the best places for golf trips if you really want to treat yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"puertorico\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;\">Royal Isabela &#8211; Puerto Rico<\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to go too far if you\u2019re looking for a bit of tropical golf. Puerto Rico is home to some really good quality courses &#8211; Perhaps the best being the stunning, coastal Royal Isabela club. Located on the northwest coast, its 426 acres of Atlantic views and pristine greens, all set within one of the most decadent and luxurious resorts on the island. With a year-round temperate climate, Puerto Rico is a golfing paradise &#8211; and Royal Isabela the jewel in the crown. It&#8217;s challenging, 73 par round will enthrall you, even if the coastal conditions embarrass your game.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31238\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31238\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-31238 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Golf-at-Sunset.jpg\" alt=\"Golf at Sunset\" width=\"747\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Golf-at-Sunset.jpg 747w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Golf-at-Sunset-300x189.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-31238\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glorious weather awaits.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But apart from the sumptuous surroundings and 5-star accommodation, what makes Puerto Rico one of the best golf vacation destinations is the price. Certainly compared to some of the aforementioned courses, you can live like a king or queen here for a fraction of the cost. And in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017, resorts are extensively rebuilding, eager to once again attract golf fans from all over the world. There\u2019s no better time to enjoy this bucket list golf trip than now.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h2 id=\"australia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 24pt;\">Royal Melbourne &#8211; Victoria &#8211; Australia<\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another course by the indubitable Mackenzie, the Royal Melbourne Club is Australia\u2019s premier golf trip destination. Located in a region known as the Sandbelt, the soil has made it particularly easy to place bunkers wherever an architect desires. As you might expect in the Scottish-Yorkshireman\u2019s deft hands, he has created an experience quite unlike any other. The sheer variety here will keep your game in check &#8211; particularly with approach shots and an abundance of tricky hazards. You\u2019ll need to be a member of an overseas club to play through though.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31239\" style=\"width: 757px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31239\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-31239 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Melbourne-Austrailia.jpg\" alt=\"Melbourne Austrailia\" width=\"747\" height=\"471\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Melbourne-Austrailia.jpg 747w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Melbourne-Austrailia-300x189.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-31239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stunning Melbourne coast.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as luck would have it, this coming December sees the return of the President\u2019s Cup to Australia\u2019s finest course, where an international team (minus Europe) takes on a team from the US. And with the wintery weather setting in throughout the northern hemisphere, it\u2019s a perfect choice for a bucket list golf vacation this year.
