The location is visually stunning, you get closer to the action than at any other track, the venue is\u00a0state-of-the-art, and every attendee gets treated like a VIP.\u00a0For these reasons alone, heading to Abu Dhabi is a dream trip, but there are also many other reasons why this destination is so special. Here are a few:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rich cultural experiences<\/strong>\u00a0Right now, several huge museums are being constructed in the Saadiyat Cultural District, including the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saadiyatculturaldistrict.ae\/en\/saadiyat-cultural-district\/louvre-abu-dhabi\/\">Louvre Abu Dhabi<\/a> &#8211; as a\u00a0second location for the famous Paris art museum, and the third Guggenheim Museum, which has been designed by Frank Gehry. Abu Dhabi is getting more culturally exciting all the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Incredible hotels\u00a0<\/strong>Luxury takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to hotels in Abu Dhabi. Things you might consider high-end at hotels in Europe and North America come as standard in Abu Dhabi, and hotels compete to offer the very best and unique perks. These perks include private malls, water parks, spas that go beyond anything you&#8217;ll have experienced anywhere else in the world, dedicated lifestyle consultants, and much more. Also, because hotels are competing to be the best, rates are very competitive so it can feel like you&#8217;re getting quite the bargain compared to what you&#8217;d pay elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A rich heritage<\/strong> Abu Dhabi isn&#8217;t just about what&#8217;s new and exciting and imported from elsewhere, it has a rich culture of its own that is\u00a0easy to access. Want to go out in the desert with a falconry master? Experience a night under the stars on silk cushions\u00a0listening to traditional music and feasting? There are many wonderful experiences you can take part in that reflect Abu Dhabi&#8217;s history and culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shopping<\/strong>\u00a0Yes there are fabulous upscale malls\u00a0where you can splurge on whatever designer clothes, shoes, bags etc make you happy, but you can also venture out to traditional souks and bazaars to track down authentic local wares to take home. There&#8217;s even a traditional camel market that you can visit &#8211; though that may be a bigger souvenir than you&#8217;d actually want to take home with you!<\/p>\n<p><strong>World class dining<\/strong>\u00a0All the luxury that you&#8217;ll find in Abu Dhabi also spills over into the city&#8217;s flourishing restaurant scene. You&#8217;ll find restaurants from the likes of Marco Pierre White\u00a0and\u00a0Hakkasan (whose sister restaurant in London is Michelin starred), and all manner of cuisine from South African steakhouses to Chinese inspired to Mediterranean style plates and more. Whatever food you love, you&#8217;ll be happy eating in Abu Dhabi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The nightlife<\/strong>\u00a0If you&#8217;re in Abu Dhabi around F1 time, the nightlife there is crazy fun (and of course Roadtrips will get you into the best parties). You&#8217;ll have a chance not only to socialize with the drivers at the Amber Lounge after the race, but also with the many visiting celebrities that head there to celebrate too (in the past this has included the likes of Bono, Naomi Campbell, Liz Hurley, Rod Stewart, and many more).<\/p>\n<p><em>Want to experience Abu Dhabi?
