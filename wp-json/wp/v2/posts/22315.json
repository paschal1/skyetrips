Here are some of the very best things to do when visiting the principality, all of which we can add into your itinerary when you travel with us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1. ARRIVE IN STYLE If you\u2019re going to do Monaco, you\u2019ve got to do it right and that\u2019s why helicopter transfers from Nice airport are a standard inclusion for our Monte-Carlo guests. Not only will you feel like royalty, you\u2019ll get some spectacular views of the principality and the coast from the air. As a bonus, it\u2019s also the fastest way to get you to this amazing destination.<\/p>\n<p>2. PALAIS DU PRINCE Yes, it\u2019s one of those attractions that you\u2019ll find in every travel guide but it really is spectacular. The walk up to the palace will take you through the narrow cobblestone streets of Old Monte-Carlo (Monaco-Ville), which is deserving of a visit in itself. Once you arrive at the Palais you can marvel at the grandeur of this magnificent piece of architecture, home to the ruling Grimaldi family for over 700 years. It\u2019s worth timing your visit to coincide with the changing of the guard at 11:55 a.m. While you\u2019re there, don\u2019t forget to check out the stunning view (yes, they do seem to be everywhere) of the city down below.<\/p>\n<p>3. CASINO DE MONTE-CARLO This isn\u2019t your typical casino. Even non-gamblers will be impressed by this 150+ year-old famed 1 3 institution. Its elegant Belle \u00c9poque d\u00e9cor is stunning and the clientele equally so. Go for the games, the drinks or take a tour. Words don\u2019t do it justice, it\u2019s a must see. People watching at its best.<\/p>\n<p>4. OCEANOGRAPHIC MUSEUM If you\u2019re traveling with the family (or even if you\u2019re not), the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oceano.mc\/en\">Oceanographic Museum<\/a> near the Prince\u2019s Palace is a cool place to visit. The building itself is actually built into the rock, a pretty spectacular sight. There\u2019s close to one hundred aquariums full of thousands of marine species to check out. We also love the rooftop restaurant; it\u2019s a great place for some refreshment during or after your visit.<\/p>\n<p>5. EXOTIC GARDEN OF MONACO There are few things that shock us about Monaco anymore. The principality has everything so why wouldn\u2019t it have one of the world\u2019s most extensive collections of exotic succulents (simply defined as plants which have acclimatized to dry climates e.g. cacti) on display. In all seriousness though, this unique garden is absolutely fascinating. Unlike your typical garden, you\u2019ll wander alongside craggy cliffs and underground caverns. Plants have been brought in from all over the world and put on display in this impressive garden, which has been around for over 80 years.<\/p>\n<p><em>Ready to make 2017 the year that you get to Monte-Carlo and witness this incredible sporting event for yourself? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> to start planning your dream trip to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/monaco-grand-prix-packages\/\">Monaco Grand Prix<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9\" id=\"hs-cta-1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9\"><!--[if lte IE 8]>\n\n<div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div>\n\n<![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/2166909\/1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9\"  target=\"_blank\" ><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/2166909\/1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9.png\"  alt=\"FREE Monaco Travel\u00a0Guide\"\/><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(2166909, '1cfbf3fb-955b-47ff-a627-fee0ff1a54d9', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We absolutely adore Monaco, and attending the Grand Prix there every year is definitely a highlight for the Roadtrips team.
