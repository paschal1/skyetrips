The trouble is unless you\u2019re well-versed in the sport; very few of you know these iconic courses by name.<\/p>\n<p>The top five must-see British Open Golf Courses are listed below. As a bonus, both their actual designation and their notable designation are included to help you remember the course particulars:<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Course #1: <\/strong><em><strong>That place where golf was invented. <\/strong><\/em><strong>Officially known as: Muirfield Golf Course, Scotland<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While St. Andrews <strong><em>is<\/em><\/strong> widely known as \u201cthe home of golf\u201d (more on that later), this course is the real birthplace of the sport. The <em>Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers<\/em> sat at these tables and wrote down the first rules of golf. To this day, you can sit at the community tables alongside members and connect with the very roots of the sport.<\/p>\n<p>Many visitors enjoy a full day of golfing complete with an all-world lunch. The course itself remains a true test of golf; being consistently rated among the top ten in the world. Just remember gentlemen, a jacket is still an on-course requirement, so don\u2019t leave home without it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course #2: <\/strong><em><strong>That place where Tiger Woods cried.<\/strong><\/em><strong> Officially known as: Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Merseyside, England<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This course has hosted the British Open at least a dozen times. In addition to Woods\u2019 emotional performance in 2006-winning the title just two months after his father\u2019s death, this course also hosted the first competition between Great Britain and the United States in 1921.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course #3: <\/strong><em><strong>That place where Donald Trump laid claim to a piece of golfing history. <\/strong><\/em><strong>\u00a0Officially known as: Alisa Course, Turnberry Resort, Scotland<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>True, Donald Trump may own the course now, but this four-time British Open host has an even bigger claim to fame.\u00a0 In 1977, Tom Watson beat golf legend Jack Nicklaus on this very course.\u00a0 The showdown became known as the \u201cDuel in the Sun.\u201d \u00a0Watson tried to repeat his victory 32 years later against another opponent, but his single-shot triumph over Nicklaus would never be duplicated.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to walk the cliffs like the golfing greats of both past and present; the good news is, as far as British Open Golf Courses go, this one is relatively easy to secure a tee time at. Beware of the windy back nine and the resort-like atmosphere; no old school club experience here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course #4: <\/strong><em><strong>That place with the odd-looking clubhouse. <\/strong><\/em><strong>Officially known as: Royal Birkdale, England<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The art-decoclubhouse may be its signature, but golfers count it among their favorite stops because there\u2019s not a weak hole in the entire layout. This nine-time British Open host has proven to be worth its salt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Course #5: <\/strong><em><strong>That place known as the home of golf. <\/strong><\/em><strong>Officially known as: The Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our list has brought us full circle to this year\u2019s host. Once about every five years, the British Open returns to this historic course, where 5 golfing greats have won two titles each; it&#8217;s\u00a0a sight to behold. And yes, you too can play here!<\/p>\n<p>This is a mere\u00a0glimpse of the wonders British Open Golf Courses hold.
