The question isn\u2019t whether you will buy something, it\u2019s when and how much. No doubt you\u2019ll have a long list of requests from friends and family but when to buy it all will require some careful planning. Buy it too early and you\u2019ll be lugging it around with you all day. Buy it too late in the tournament and you\u2019ll find little selection left. It\u2019s a fine line and the struggle is real. Your brother-in-law and your friends at the club are counting on you.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Food\"><\/span>The Food<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"masters pimento cheese sandwich\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-pimento-cheese-sandwich.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Most first time visitors are shocked at the food and drink prices at Augusta National. Not because they\u2019re so high, because they are so wildly inexpensive. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in a different era. Where else in the world of sport can you grab a beer and one of those famous pillowy soft pimento cheese sandwiches for just $5.50?<\/p>\n<p style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Chairs\"><\/span>The Chairs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg\" alt=\"masters chairs\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47605\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-chairs-300x158.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-chairs-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-chairs-768x403.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/masters-chairs.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>If you want to sit down somewhere other than the grandstands on Augusta National, you\u2019ll want to purchase or bring along a chair (but you\u2019ll need to make sure it\u2019s collapsible and doesn\u2019t have armrests \u2013 Augusta National is strict with their rules). We definitely recommend buying a Masters chair; few things are more fun than showing up at a summer event and nonchalantly putting down your green Masters-logoed chair. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right, I did go the Masters this year.\u201d Spots are first come, first serve. Many patrons (as you\u2019ve likely noticed on TV, Masters attendees are referred to as patrons, never fans) will claim their spot early in the day and come and go as they please. There\u2019s no need to worry about someone taking your chair or spot, that\u2019s simply unheard of at this event and one of the many joys of the Masters. If you plan to plant a chair on Sunday for the lucky golfer\u2019s emotional walk up 18, you will need to be there very early. It\u2019s coveted real estate on Sunday.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Rules\"><\/span>The Rules<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As with anything related to the great game of golf, it is important to know the rules. Masters patrons are keen observers of the etiquette and rules of this well-heeled event. Don\u2019t worry, before you go we\u2019ll send you a complete list of items that you can and can\u2019t bring with you, like no phones or cameras after the practice rounds conclude. So for now, politeness rules the day, decorum is the modus operandi, and make sure your golf outfit is properly matched. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Souvenir_Photo\"><\/span>The Souvenir Photo<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You know how they say you can\u2019t get a picture during the Masters? Well, that\u2019s not entirely true. To be clear, we are not recommending flouting the very serious rule about cameras. Instead, as you are making your way towards the Par 3 Course, you will likely see a line forming near the first hole. This is the picture line. Right near Founders Circle the Club will take your picture with the magnolias, Masters logo, and clubhouse in the background. After they have taken your picture, they will give you a small plastic card that will allow you to retrieve the picture online later. Apart from the time spent, it won\u2019t cost you a thing. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Big_Decision\"><\/span>The Big Decision<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download-300x179.jpeg\" alt=\"augusta masters field\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download-300x179.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download-1024x612.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download-768x459.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/download.jpeg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>For many people the highlight of the tournament is watching the last few deciding holes on Sunday afternoon. The anticipation and excitement is there and the whole week often comes down to the back nine at Augusta. While most patrons want to stay to experience this live, it makes for a challenge to find a good spot to view the action from. In fact, many patrons will leave early and head to a hospitality venue or somewhere else where they can watch the action on TV to guarantee themselves a great view. Should you stay or should you go? It\u2019s something you may want to think about before Sunday.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Hospitality\"><\/span>The Hospitality<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>To do hospitality or not do hospitality, that is the question. This is something that is very much personal preference and another unique aspect that makes Augusta special. Unlike any other golf event, there is no hospitality on the course at Augusta National. This has created a variety of offsite hospitality venues, each with their own strengths. Roadtrips partners with the most solid hospitality providers and we can match you with the most well suited option. <\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Extensions\"><\/span>The Extensions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>After a few days on a golf high, we know first hand how hard it is to head back to real life. Instead, many of our clients choose to extend their trip with a few extra days in Hilton Head, Savannah, or a number of other golf destinations in the area.<\/p>\n<p>One of the great things about travelling with Roadtrips is our team of professional hosts comprised of international sporting event experts and local hosts.
