No stranger to hosting the Super Bowl, this city knows how to keep NFL fans and visitors busy throughout the big weekend and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>With so much to see and do, it\u2019s essential that you plan your visit to make sure you get the most out of your Super Bowl weekend in this vibrant location. To help you decide, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of our favorite things to do in Minneapolis.<\/p>\n<h2>1. The Ultimate Super Bowl Tailgate Party<\/h2>\n<p>Charge up the pre-game excitement with a visit to the Ultimate Tailgate Party. Mingle with NFL players and other VIPs as you enjoy the pregame with the help of a premium open bar and an all-you-can-eat buffet prepared by celebrity chef Guy Fieri and top caterer Aaron May.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Minnehaha Park<\/h2>\n<p>Home to the beautiful Minnehaha Falls and popular with families and dog lovers alike, this city park is the ideal way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a few hours. The falls are one of the most popular features of the park, standing at an impressive 53-feet high. They turn into a gorgeous winter wonderland when the waterfall freezes over the colder months.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to wrap up warm for this one as temperatures in Minneapolis during February are set <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/weatherspark.com\/m\/10405\/2\/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Minneapolis-Minnesota-United-States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to be pretty cold<\/a><\/strong>. If it\u2019s cold enough, you may just get the chance to see the falls in all their frozen glory!<\/p>\n<h2>3. Foshay Museum and Observation Deck<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling a little adventurous, why not take in the stunning 360-degree views of Minneapolis from 30 floors up? Located at the top of the W Hotel, the Foshay observation deck gives you a view of Minneapolis that you won\u2019t find anywhere else in the city. Our favorite time to check out the view is at night when the lights of the city are brighter than the halftime show.<\/p>\n<p>When you finish, we recommend taking yourself downstairs to the Prohibition Bar where you can sit back and relax with a cocktail in hand.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Spoonbridge and Cherry at the Walker Art Center<\/h2>\n<p>No trip to Minneapolis would be complete without a visit to the famous spoon and cherry sculpture located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. It\u2019s an iconic symbol of Minneapolis and provides an amazing backdrop for some fun picture taking. You can make it look like you\u2019re taking a bite of the cherry or holding the spoon, the finished pictures will make a great Instagram post!<\/p>\n<h2>5. The Mall of America<\/h2>\n<p>You really can\u2019t visit Minneapolis without a spot of shopping, and there\u2019s no better place than The Mall of America, it\u2019s a shopping experience like no other. With over 500 stores and 50 restaurants, there\u2019s something to please everyone. And if you tire of shopping, head over to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/nickelodeonuniverse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nickelodeon Universe<\/a><\/strong> and take a ride on the rollercoaster or check out the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.visitsealife.com\/minnesota\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sea Life aquarium<\/a><\/strong>. It\u2019s home to thousands of sea creatures, including sharks and sea turtles.<\/p>\n<h2>6. 112 Eatery<\/h2>\n<p>Looking for a buzzing restaurant for a great meal? Then 112 Eatery will fit the bill. Positioned in the heart of downtown Minneapolis, this is one of our favorite spots in the city. Minneapolis chef (and James Beard award winner) Isaac Becker is at the helm and the American cuisine is creative and incredibly delicious. Be sure to reserve a table as this place is super popular.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Minneapolis Institute of Art<\/h2>\n<p>Catch your breath and take some time out from the excitement of Super Bowl weekend with a visit to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Take in the fine art and explore the magnificent exhibitions of everyone from Monet to Van Gogh. Keep up to date with the latest exhibitions taking place this February through their <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/new.artsmia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Try Out a Winter Sport<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s cold in Minneapolis in February so why not embrace it? Super Bowl weekend will be a great time to try out a new winter sport or polish your skills on one you already enjoy. With skating, snowshoeing, ice fishing, snowboarding and many more, there\u2019s sure to be something for everyone.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Sportsology at the Science Museum of Minnesota<\/h2>\n<p>A really fun way to learn some of the science behind sport, this interactive exhibit is a fun way to spend a few hours. Explore different aspects of sport, challenge your travelling companion (or even a professional athlete) to a virtual competition, and check out everything else the exhibit has to offer. There\u2019s plenty to see in the rest of the museum too!<\/p>\n<h2>10. Saint Paul Winter Carnival<\/h2>\n<p>Located just a short drive from the U.S Bank Stadium, the Winter Carnival is an outside party like no other. There are a number of carnival events held between January 25th and February 10th but the Carnival\u2019s signature events \u2013 three parades, ice carving, and a snow sculpting competition \u2013 are the biggest draw for visitors. So, chill out and wrap up and check out America\u2019s longest running winter festival.<\/p>\n<p>Want to have the best experience possible over Minneapolis Super Bowl weekend? We\u2019d love to help!
