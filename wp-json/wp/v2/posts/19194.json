If you\u2019re a racing fan, you don\u2019t want to miss the excitement that builds in Spain around the prestigious event. It\u2019s held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya annually, and the track is perhaps the most diverse in the Formula One circuit, with every type of corner.<\/p>\n<p>More than just the Spanish Grand Prix awaits you.\u00a0Barcelona harbors a rich history, much of it evident in the architecture of the city. You can\u2019t miss the Sagrada Familia, a basilica that has been under construction since 1882. It was designed by Gaudi, whose inspiration is seen throughout the city as a way to employ some of the poor, out of work citizens of the city. Still under construction, it still has not reached its full intended height of 600 feet.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Another architectural wonder is the Gothic Quarter, the city center of Barcelona. There you\u2019ll find a variety of styles and plenty of activities; including street artists, dance clubs (discoteks), and tons of excellent Spanish food. You\u2019ll also find it intriguing to visit the Olympic Grounds, where the 1992 Summer Olympics were held and the Olympic Stadium still stands. This spot overlooks the beautiful city from above, giving you a splendid view.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re in the area, visit Nova Icaria Beach, one of the most beautiful seaside locations in Barcelona. Here, you can bask in the sun or take part in watersports, including taking lessons in windsurfing, paddle boarding, and kayaking. The beach is next to the Olympic marina and observatory and also near the Icaria shopping center. If you\u2019re looking for a quieter day at the beach, check out Ocata Beach, with its white sand, just a half-hour train trip outside the city.<\/p>\n<p>Barcelona is a center for liberal arts and culture, so you\u2019ll want to take advantage of the vast array of art. One specific piece of art that is a huge attraction is the Magic Fountain of Montjuic \u2013 also known fondly as the \u2018dancing\u2019 fountain. Watch the water change colors and dance to a soundtrack of music, and admire the construction of the beautiful piece.<\/p>\n<p>Another excellent place to view visual art is the Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya, a palace full of art dating all the way from the 11th century up through modern times. If you like the palatial look, visit another of Gaudi\u2019s architectural wonders, the Palau Guell, opened in 1888 as the home of industrial tycoon Eusebi Guell. Today, you can purchase tour tickets to explore the mansion and see how the \u2018other half\u2019 lived over a century ago.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes time to sample the cuisine, you\u2019ll find a rich variety of cultures from which to choose. If you want to sample the taste of Catalan, the province in which Barcelona is located, try <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mandarinoriental.com\/barcelona\/fine-dining\/moments\/\">Moments<\/a>, where you can try veal stew, or an incredible shrimp tartare. If you want something completely out of the norm, this restaurant also has a unique \u2018anti-aging\u2019 menu. You might also check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ritzcarlton.com\/en\/Properties\/Barcelona\/Dining\/Arola\/Default.htm\">Arola<\/a>, located in the Hotel Arts, for its beautiful terrace and live music. Try the seabass asada, with one of the over 900 wines in their cellar.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/trip\/spanish-grand-prix\/\">Spanish Grand Prix<\/a> may be the event that brings you to Barcelona, but once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll want to stay a while and really enjoy the rich and welcoming environment of the city.
