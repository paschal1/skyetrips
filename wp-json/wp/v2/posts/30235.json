Tokyo felt clean and safe, not typically words I\u2019d use to describe a major urban center. Traffic was a welcome surprise, in general it doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue apart from holidays. The locals were friendly and welcoming, and even without speaking Japanese, I didn\u2019t have much trouble communicating or getting around the city.<\/p>\n<p><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/is-tokyo-worth-visiting\/\">Is Tokyo worth visiting for the 2020 Summer Games?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_best_places_to_stay_in_Tokyo\"><\/span>What are the best places to stay in Tokyo?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Tokyo is such a unique city. There\u2019s no true \u201cdowntown\u201d core but rather a series of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own distinct flavor. I spent a lot of my time in Shinjuku and Ginza, two of Tokyo\u2019s most popular districts. Both neighborhoods are vibrant and compelling, brimming with shops, restaurants, entertainment, and attractions.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_there_to_do_in_Shinjuku\"><\/span>What is there to do in Shinjuku?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Shinjuku was a great area to begin my trip. It\u2019s lively and exciting with no shortage of things to do. You can find pretty much any type of restaurant you\u2019re in the mood for, the nightlife is some of the best anywhere (I highly recommend experiencing karaoke in its home country), and the shopping is impressive to say the least. Department stores and megastores are plentiful and seriously mind-blowing. They boast floors and floors of anything you could possibly need, some 24 hours a day. Shinjuku is also home to Olympic Stadium, and will be a huge hub at the 2020 Summer Games.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_there_to_do_in_Ginza\"><\/span>What is there to do in Ginza?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Ginza is known as a shopper\u2019s paradise, and has earned comparisons to Rodeo Drive. This is the place to find boutiques from the top fashion houses and upscale department stores. While shopping wasn\u2019t high on my list of things to do this time around, I couldn\u2019t resist taking a peek in some of these incredible shops. The department stores are bustling and their food halls were something quite incredible. I marveled at display after display of treats, from elegant pastries to fresh sushi and everything in between, each impeccably presented. In Ginza, there\u2019s also no shortage of great restaurants and attractions, including the revered Imperial Palace.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_best_hotels_in_Tokyo_to_stay_in\"><\/span>What are the best hotels in Tokyo to stay in?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Shinjuku and Ginza are also home to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/hotels\/\">2020 Summer Games hotels<\/a>, which I visited during my trip.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Park_Hyatt_Tokyo_Review\"><\/span>Park Hyatt Tokyo Review<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I was really excited to visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/hotels\/#parkhyatt\">Park Hyatt Tokyo<\/a>. The hotel, which was featured in the movie <em>Lost in Translation<\/em>, is a Tokyo icon. The hotel occupies the top 14 floors of three high rise towers and as you can imagine, it offers some pretty phenomenal 360 degree views. My favorite view was from the famous New York Bar on the 52nd floor. It was so cool to sit in the same bar where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson sat in <em>Lost in Translation<\/em> and enjoy a drink overlooking the endless twinkling lights of the city. Actually, the views everywhere were memorable, from the guest rooms to the pool to the restaurants.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30242\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/park-hyatt-2.jpg\" alt=\"park hyatt New York Bar\" width=\"582\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">Views of the famous New York Bar on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt Tokyo<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hilton_Tokyo_Review\"><\/span>Hilton Tokyo Review<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Just a few blocks from the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/hotels\/#hilton\">Hilton Tokyo<\/a>. The location was great: convenient to Shinjuku Station, lots to explore in the area, and walkable to a variety of restaurants, shops, and green spaces. The hotel is big and has everything one would need in a hotel: great restaurants, lounges; a fitness center; indoor pool with sauna and hot tub; tennis courts; and lots more. They are currently in the process of renovating their executive lounge, which will make a great place to relax during the action of the Summer Games. The hotel also has some impressive views, including some quintessential Mt. Fuji vistas.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Four_Seasons_Hotel_Tokyo_at_Marunouchi_Review\"><\/span>Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi Review<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In Ginza, I first visited the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/hotels\/#fourseasons\">Four Seasons Marunouchi<\/a>. This boutique property felt cozy and intimate. The guest rooms were luxe and modern and there was a lovely spa that I wish I could have stayed in all day! I didn\u2019t have a chance to try the restaurant but it is headed by a Michelin-starred chef and is a favorite of Roadtrips&#8217; President, Dave Guenther. The hotel is well located for exploring the city: just before we arrived at the hotel I got my first glimpse of the Imperial Palace grounds, which are stunning!<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hyatt_Centric_Ginza_Tokyo_Review\"><\/span>Hyatt Centric Ginza Tokyo Review<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The nearby <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/summer-games\/tokyo-2020-packages\/hotels\/#hyattcentric\">Hyatt Centric Ginza<\/a> was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s quite new (it opened last year) and boasts a fantastic location on the popular Namiki-dori Street, with heaps of shops and restaurants in the area. The guest rooms were contemporary with Japanese charm, and are spacious and super functional. You can tell a lot of thought went into the design. One of my most memorable meals of the trip was at the Hyatt\u2019s Namiki667 restaurant, which had an outdoor terrace, somewhat of a rarity in Tokyo.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Final_thoughts_about_Tokyo\"><\/span>Final thoughts about Tokyo<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Overall, I was so impressed with the hotels and the neighborhoods they are located in. I can confidently say that any of these properties would be a fantastic option for Summer Games travelers.<\/p>\n<p>I could go on and on about Tokyo but I\u2019ll save some for the next blog.
