Fact is, as much as we love heading to Monte Carlo for the fantastic sports cars and race itself, we must admit that the stars and royalty in attendance are a big part of what makes this such a fun event to attend year after year.<\/p>\n<p>Those attending this year had the opportunity to hobnob with the likes of Patrick Dempsey, Lady Victoria Hervey, Victoria Silvstedt, several of the cast of Game of Thrones, and Ronan Keating, to namedrop a few of the famous folks in attendance. Lewis Hamilton happily posed for selfies with fans, and superstar DJ Carl Cox played a set at Zelo\u2019s nightclub in Monaco.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re impressed with movie stars, royalty, or celebrities of the sporting kind, Monaco never disappoints. Duane Penner, Roadtrips VP of Sales, attends the Monaco Grand Prix almost every year, and says that his biggest sightings over the years have included Bono, David Beckham, Elizabeth Hurley, and David Hasselhoff. \u201cI was there one year partying with Boris Becker. For some people that\u2019s just an old guy they\u2019ve never heard of, but to me he is one of the greatest tennis players ever,\u201d says Penner.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/amber-lounge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amber Lounge<\/a> is where the hottest Monaco Grand Prix parties happen, and access is an add-on that many of our guests choose to do with us when coming to this event.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe drivers come every Sunday to the Amber Lounge, so if you\u2019re an F1 fan then it&#8217;s super cool because all the guys are there and they\u2019re hanging out together, looking to have a good time now that the stress is over. It\u2019s quite the party,\u201d Penner says. \u201cThe drivers being there pulls out the other celebrities, such as Nicole Scherzinger who is dating a driver, plus there are supermodels, and past-drivers are all there. The Prince of Monaco and his wife are always at the Amber Lounge at least once, which is also pretty cool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14876\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/monaco-montage-250x125.jpg\" alt=\"monaco montage\" width=\"250\" height=\"125\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Amber Lounge is one of the best places to spot celebrities en mass, literally hanging out in groups, which is quite the thing to see. You\u2019ll also see them in hospitality, either in one of the team paddocks or clubs. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll be there in a paddock and not realize that you\u2019re standing just a few feet away from a celebrity until they flash up on one of the screens there,\u201d says Penner.<\/p>\n<p>It rained on race day this year, which was annoying, but it did lead to a very dramatic race with all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E7xWlMrRVtY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crashes<\/a> and messing up on the tire change \u2013 this will be a race that people will talk about for a long time just because it had so much drama. \u201cThere\u2019s always something different with Monaco, but the things that stay the same \u2013 the cars, the celebrities, the yachts, the money \u2013 just make it incredible,\u201d says Penner. \u201cEvery year we take guests who aren\u2019t even race fans, they just go because all that history and glamour attracts them. For some people it&#8217;s just something that they have to check off the bucket list, but for other people they go regularly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Are you ready to cross the Monaco Grand Prix off of your bucket list? We\u2019re organizing another great trip there for 2017, and can create a customized itinerary that gets you close to the race action and all the fabulous extras that make this event so special.
