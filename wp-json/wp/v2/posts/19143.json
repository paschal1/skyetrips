But if you truly want a high-end sports travel experience, then you need to book your trip to the Games now, and with a sports travel agency.\u00a0<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Book Your Trip for the 2016 Summer Games Now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sports travel agency professionals will tell you that the Games in Rio are special for a bunch of different reasons. Some of them are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the first time in the history of the Games the host city is located in South America. North American travellers are expected to descend on Rio in large numbers\u00a0pushing event ticket\u00a0sales.<\/li>\n<li>New sports at the 2016 Summer Games include golf. And golf has avid fans willing to travel the globe\u00a0to watch their favorite players tee off. They are among the millions of high-end sport travellers who book early.<\/li>\n<li>Elite sports enthusiasts are after the experience of 35 sports venues for 306 sporting events. Can you imagine taking in\u00a0triathlon and beach volleyball at the world famous Copacabana Beach? Or watching soccer\u00a0at the same stadiums as the 2014 World Cup matches? They are booking now.<\/li>\n<li>Rio is an exotic, romantic, adventure-filled destination all on its own, which will attract more visitors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Given the unique draw for these Games, tickets and first-class accommodations will be scooped up quickly. Booking now with a sports travel agency will not only ensure that you access the venues and events you want, but that you&#8217;ll have the high-end sports travel experience you&#8217;ve been imagining.\u00a0With over a million guests expected to visit Rio during the Summer Games, demand for hotel space is expected to far outstrip supply. And hotels of quality in the right location will be even harder to come by. Booking early is the only way to assure yourself a chance to be a part of this exciting and exclusive event.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Book with a Sports Travel Agency?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Attending the 2016 Summer Games requires\u00a0advanced planning and knowledge of how to obtain tickets, accommodations and travel around the city.\u00a0Sports travel agencies like Roadtrips can design your<a href=\"\/summer-games\/rio-de-janeiro-2016-packages\/day-tours-excursions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0custom trip<\/a> so you will\u00a0experience only\u00a0the best that Rio and the Games have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Sports travel agencies know how much this trip\u00a0means to you, which is why they create a no-hassle experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agency professionals will be in Rio\u00a0before and\u00a0during the games.
