We already have our eyes on what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-best-games-group-stage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Group Stage games we can\u2019t miss<\/a>, but here we\u2019ve also pinpointed a few top players that we\u2019re really keen to see in action on the big stage. Some of these players are household names by now, thanks to their prolific talent, but we\u2019ve also dug a bit deeper to highlight some perhaps lesser-known names who are really worth checking out as the tournament progresses. Make a note of these names now, as they\u2019ll be talked about again and again over the coming months. With that said, here&#8217;s our list!<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_11 counter-hierarchy counter-numeric ez-toc-grey\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\"><i class=\"ez-toc-glyphicon ez-toc-icon-toggle\"><\/i><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class=\"ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1\"><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Lionel_Messi_%E2%80%93_Argentina\" title=\"Lionel Messi &#8211; Argentina\">Lionel Messi &#8211; Argentina<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Cristiano_Ronaldo_%E2%80%93_Portugal\" title=\"Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Portugal\">Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Portugal<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Mohamad_Salah_%E2%80%93_Egypt\" title=\"Mohamad Salah \u2013 Egypt\">Mohamad Salah \u2013 Egypt<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#David_De_Gea_%E2%80%93_Spain\" title=\"David De Gea \u2013 Spain\">David De Gea \u2013 Spain<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Samuel_Umtiti_%E2%80%93_France\" title=\"Samuel Umtiti \u2013 France\">Samuel Umtiti \u2013 France<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Paulinho_%E2%80%93_Brazil\" title=\"Paulinho \u2013 Brazil\">Paulinho \u2013 Brazil<\/a><\/li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/2018-world-cup-players-to-watch\/#Neymar_Jr_%E2%80%93_Brazil\" title=\"Neymar Jr \u2013 Brazil\">Neymar Jr \u2013 Brazil<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lionel_Messi_%E2%80%93_Argentina\"><\/span>Lionel Messi &#8211; Argentina<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Messi is one of the most popular and famous soccer players of recent years and one who will be closely watched by everyone throughout the tournament. A true \u201conce a generation\u201d player, Messi\u2019s attacking style and dribbling ability make him almost untouchable. And the statistics back this up \u2013 he regularly scores 50+ goals a season, putting him firmly on course to become one of the sport\u2019s greatest ever players. If you want to see entertaining football and individual prowess, keep an eye on Messi.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cristiano_Ronaldo_%E2%80%93_Portugal\"><\/span>Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Portugal<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You knew this man would be on the list. A prolific goal scorer and assist machine \u2013 left foot, right foot, head \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. Ronaldo is always pitted against Messi when it comes to claiming Player of the Year accolades, and for a very good reason. First gaining prominence for his speed, skill and unique shot, Ronaldo has always found a way to stay on top. In his older years, he has adapted his game, further progressing his positioning and always finding the back of the net. If you\u2019ve watched Goal of the Season videos, then you\u2019ve definitely seen some of Ronaldo\u2019s strikes. A fascinating player to watch at this year\u2019s World Cup, he\u2019s sure to be a game changer in any match he plays. What\u2019s more, he will be full of confidence on the international stage, having captained his country to success in the European Championship in 2016.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mohamad_Salah_%E2%80%93_Egypt\"><\/span>Mohamad Salah \u2013 Egypt<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Salah could be a new name for some on this list. The forward has had a fantastic season with Liverpool, comfortably leading the top scorers in the Premier League and battling neck and neck with Messi for the top scorer accolade in Europe. Regarded by all as an exciting player, Salah attacks the game and uses his electrifying pace and a keen eye for the goal to be a literal game changer. He is one of those rare players that you can pretty much bank on scoring in nearly every game. If you\u2019re looking for entertainment, you definitely don\u2019t want to miss this guy at the World Cup!<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"David_De_Gea_%E2%80%93_Spain\"><\/span>David De Gea \u2013 Spain<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re so used to hearing about forwards and wingers \u2013 the types of players who create and score goals \u2013 that sometimes the defenders and goalkeepers don\u2019t get a look in. Well, we\u2019re going to change all that with David De Gea, a goalkeeper who is certainly worth watching. A terrific keeper isn\u2019t always a common thing in soccer, but De Gea has been Manchester United\u2019s best player for a couple of seasons in a row now. Known for making big saves in particularly important moments, he is a keeper that Spain can feel confident in. And for viewers, seeing someone make a near impossible save, or a triple save, can be as exciting as seeing a brilliant goal scored. Basically, if you can beat De Gea, then you\u2019ve scored a pretty sweet goal \u2013 hats off.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Samuel_Umtiti_%E2%80%93_France\"><\/span>Samuel Umtiti \u2013 France<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Like De Gea, Umtiti might not get the recognition that he deserves. The young central defender has impressed massively over the past few seasons, cementing his place in the Barcelona backline as well as the French national team. A strong defensive line is key to a successful team and world-class defenders are few and far between. Umtiti\u2019s impressive performances have placed him in good stead to become one of the best, so be sure to check him out this year as he stops some of soccer\u2019s best attacking players.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Paulinho_%E2%80%93_Brazil\"><\/span>Paulinho \u2013 Brazil<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be a list of players to watch in the World Cup without a name from the Brazilian team. Paulinho, again of Barcelona, is a powerful box-to-box midfielder who is a strong presence on the field and has the ability to control the pace of a game. If you watch Brazil play in the World Cup this Summer \u2013 and you should \u2013 keep an eye on this guy and observe how he controls the tempo of the game and makes an impact all over the field. That is, if you\u2019re not too distracted by the next player\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Neymar_Jr_%E2%80%93_Brazil\"><\/span>Neymar Jr \u2013 Brazil<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Again of Brazil, and formerly of Barcelona, Neymar became the most expensive footballer in the world when he moved to Paris Saint-Germain for an eye-watering \u00a3198 million! That\u2019s about $270 million! It\u2019s certainly a staggering figure, but those in the know believe that if anyone is worth that amount of cash, it\u2019s Neymar, as he has been lighting up the sport for some time now. Flamboyant, skillful, confident and always entertaining, he is sure to make many a highlight reel!<\/p>\n<p>And there you have it, our list of must-watch players at the 2018 World Cup. There are plenty of other players worth noting, but the above provides a good mixture of pure attacking talent, along with a nod to those in defensive positions. And whatever happens this Summer, there will be skill, excitement, joy, sadness and every other emotion \u2013 you gotta love the beautiful game!<\/p>\n<p>Did we miss anyone?
