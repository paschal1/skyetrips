While our attention to detail and high levels of customer service are vitally important to this, what also counts is that we source the very best luxury hotels for every event that we take our guests to.<\/p>\n<p>We work with our partners across the world to secure rooms and suites well in advance of every event, often years before in fact. This means that while there may be low availability around these events, we\u2019ve had accommodations on lockdown, ready and waiting for our guests.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s blog post, we wanted to share some of our favorite hotels around the world that we use, and highlight what it is we love about them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monte-Carlo:<\/strong> \u201cMonte-Carlo has a number of great hotels, but the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotelhermitagemontecarlo.com\/\">H\u00f4tel\u00a0Hermitage\u00a0Monte-Carlo<\/a> is only one you need to know about. The gleaming white Belle Epoque facade sums up the essence of Monte-Carlo ritz and glitz: inside, it boasts one of the most famous lobbies in Europe, with a glass domed cupola designed by the famous <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gustave_Eiffel\">Gustave Eiffel<\/a>,\u201d says Roadtrips Vice President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtrips.com\/blog\/roadtrips-team-spotlight-duane-penner\/\">Duane Penner<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, the H\u00f4tel\u00a0Hermitage\u00a0Monte-Carlo is a Roadtrips guest favorite, and one that we love getting to enjoy every year. Penner has hosted at the Monaco Grand Prix many, many times, and loves the reaction that we get from our guests who choose to stay at this property.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moscow:<\/strong> \u201cThe Ritz-Carlton is Moscow\u2019s premier hotel; perfectly located to experience the city; famous for its bars and restaurants including the original Novikov restaurant and the infamous O2 Lounge with its sweeping rooftop terraces that overlook Red Square, the Kremlin and St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral,\u201d says Roadtrips President Dave Guenther.<\/p>\n<p>We have plenty of rooms and suites blocked out at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ritzcarlton.com\/en\/hotels\/europe\/moscow\">Ritz-Carlton Moscow<\/a> for the 2018 World Cup, and we know that our guests are going to love this hotel just as much as we do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seoul:<\/strong> \u201cThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fourseasons.com\/seoul\/\">Four Seasons<\/a> brings its unique brand of casual elegance and World Class luxury to the heart of Seoul; the city\u2019s best hotel with Michelin dining, top level spa and dreamy beds to sink into after a full day of Olympic excitement,&#8221; says Roadtrips President Dave Guenther.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve worked long and hard to secure the very best hotels in South Korea for the 2018 Winter Games. We\u2019re excited to show off this fascinating country\u2019s culture, food, and warm people, but know the importance of maintaining the accommodation standards that are so important to our guests. Those who come with us to the 2018 Winter Games will not be disappointed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bermuda:<\/strong> -\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosewoodhotels.com\/en\/tuckers-point-bermuda\">Rosewood Tucker\u2019s Point<\/a> is the ultimate Bermuda beach retreat on expansive grounds that have a country club feel and feature top level golf and its own pink sand beach club. Perfection!&#8221; says Guenther.<\/p>\n<p>This property is breathtaking, and offers every luxury to those who stay there. Bermuda is a glorious destination, and by staying here and looking out over the blue ocean you\u2019ll be in a state of bliss. The 2017 America\u2019s Cup will be a fun event, and this the perfect home base to return to each night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>London:<\/strong> \u201cThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.corinthia.com\/en\/hotels\/london\">Corinthia London<\/a> offers a modern take on refined British luxury; ultra comfortable rooms with every imaginable amenity; a subterranean James Bond-like spa with a series of thermal pools, a glass boxed Finnish sauna and isolation pods for deep relaxation; mouthwatering bars and restaurants including a ultra sexy champagne bar that features nightly jazz,\u201d says Guenther.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be staying at the Corinthia for both Wimbledon and the World Athletics Championships in 2017, but it is a hotel (and city) we are very familiar with. We head to Wimbledon every year, and there are always plenty of top events held in the city that make us regular visitors. This hotel is superb, and we always love staying there.<\/p>\n<p><em>Looking to book a luxurious package to your favorite sporting event?
